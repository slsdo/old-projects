The twenty seven ancestors, the greatest beings among the Dead Apostles. More than half of them had been sealed by the Church.
Among the most ancient Dead Apostles, some of the Ancestors had been slain. The reason that the Twenty Seven seats still existed was that the subordinates of the slain Ancestors inherited their seats.
The sealed Ancestors were locked within sarcophagi by the Holy Church. Since they could not be completely destroyed, they were essentially permanently imprisoned. The covens of the sealed Ancestors still existed today. They were working hard either attempting to save the Ancestors or destroy them.
