A branch of the Holy Church. A group of Executor responsible for the inquisition of heretics.
They were not Exorcists who repelled Demons, but executioners of the Demonic.
They never worked with Demon hunting organizations of any nations, and its members frequently operated alone.
The Burial Agency favored raw power above all. If an individual possessed powers that could vanquish difficult foes of the Church, he/she would be welcomed without any consideration of his status. The Agency consisted of eight members. This included seven members led by Chief Narbareck, as well as one reserve member.
