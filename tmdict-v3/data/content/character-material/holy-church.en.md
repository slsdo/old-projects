The organization that ran contrary to the “universal tolerance” of the religion.
Preaching the word of God, they absolutely did not tolerate anything against the doctrine. Although on the surface they denied the existence of “heretics,” within the ranks there existed some who rejected heretics with unmatched fervor. They turned “heretic hunting” into a profession, and a immense department was established for this purpose.
“Executors” were individuals with the power to vanquish Demons. They physically eliminated things that did not exist in the Lord’s teachings. On the other hand, Exorcists were individuals in the clergy who tolerated the existence of Demons, but merely temporarily repelled them.
