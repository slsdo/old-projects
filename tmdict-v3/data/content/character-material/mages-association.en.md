A self-preservation agency formed by practitioners of magecraft, regardless of nationality or race (of course, in name only).
Its directive was to control, conceal, and further develop magecraft.
The Association had the martial power to protect itself from those who threaten its existence. It also possessed facilities for the further development of magecraft. The Association enforced a set of laws that prevented the criminal use of magecraft.
At the moment, the center of the Association resided in London.
