Dead Apostle of the Lake. Even among the Dead Apostles, his lineage was an ancient one. Because Louvre was created by the True Ancestor as a form of amusement, namely to appreciate the “beauty” of mankind, he did not possess any exceptional powers.
A few centuries ago, he was pursued by the Executor of the Church to a lake and subsequently destroyed, but somehow he miraculously survived.
Since then, he became dedicated in enlarging his “coven” which he previously did not care about. Currently he was the subordinate of White Wing, who led the largest faction of Dead Apostles.
