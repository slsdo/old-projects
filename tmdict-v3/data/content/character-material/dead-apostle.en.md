Creatures that made up the majority of the Blood-Suckers. Considered to be the prototypical Vampires.
They were originally the emergency rations of the True Ancestors. The Dead Apostles served as living blood bags when True Ancestors could not curb their vampiric impulses.
These creatures whose blood was drained by True Ancestors and bound as servants were called Dead Apostles.
Within the ranks of Dead Apostles, there were those who were unrelated to True Ancestors. They were the ones who acquired immortality (as Vampires) at the end of their quest for magic. They also joined the secret society of Dead Apostles. Although their origins differ, they were still considered Blood Suckers.
