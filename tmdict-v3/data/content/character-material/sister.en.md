The Executor{{n1}} who arrived at Aylesbury before the party of Mr. Dawn. She had a friendly smile and the communication skills to quickly adapt to any environment. The most virtuous member of the Burial Agency.
In terms of diplomacy and intelligence, she was considered number one in the Agency. However, she really took the Agency’s motto “Endure all trials, consume all humiliations” to heart, and showed off her dazzling dance steps in her laced-up boots at every opportunity.
…However, her performances were really sloppy.
