Avenger. A member of the Twenty Seven Dead Apostle Ancestors. Number Eighteen.
He was given the title Blade (Enhance Sword) by those despised him. A Vampire who recently joined the ranks of Ancestors.
It was not unusual for Dead Apostles to wage wars against each other, and the purpose was to wrestle for power within the organization.
Usually the subordinates fought for the right to inherit the title of an Ancestor. Fighting against the other Ancestors was almost unheard of.
Enhance broke this rule, as he actively hunted for the other Ancestors.
