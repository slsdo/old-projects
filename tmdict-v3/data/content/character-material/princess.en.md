Loved gold color, despised black.
The Princess that the Priest (Merem) spoke about, of course it was that person. The kid only talked about her, it seemed that he never grew up.
On the one hand, the Princess was not very good at dealing with the Priest, making his friendly gestures seemed unacknowledged. On the other hand, the Black Princess loved the Priest very much. She loved him so much that she was hesitating whether or not to just eat him.
