Assassin. One who could slice the unbreakable like butter, and dismember the indestructible Dead Apostles. As the name suggested, a shadow who was like a Death God.
Like the Avenger, he was deemed an elusive calamity in the world of Dead Apostles.
â€¦running around doing errands with no pay, what a hard working guy.
