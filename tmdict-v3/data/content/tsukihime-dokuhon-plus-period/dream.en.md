A convenient thing.
*Kagetsu Tohya*’s key word. Normally Shiki is a person that doesn’t dream. The reason that he started dreaming frequently after coming back to the Tohno mansion was not due to his own will, but because of outside influences. Even the dream he had on the fifth day of the Arcueid and Ciel routes stemmed from the mischievousness of Arcueid’s familiar rather than his own desire. Okay, okay, if that’s mischievousness I’m all for it, hahaha.
