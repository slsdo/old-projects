A sub-heroine in *Tsukihime*. A servant working at the Tohno mansion. Sympath.
An energetic girl, that always sports a bright, unwavering smile. In the story, she was the servant assigned to Akiha, and was in charge of cooking, tending to the gardens, and managing the finances of the estate.
She has a natural cheerfulness about her, and just spending time with her is relaxing. On the other hand, she also has an extremely cool-headed and objective point of view—though she isn’t even aware of it herself.
She was an orphan taken in by Tohno Makihisa together with Hisui, and spent her days confined in Makihisa’s room. Then, around the time that Akiha entered her second year of middle school—after Shiki was put up for adoption—she found out about Kohaku’s relationship with Makihisa and made her a normal servant working on the mansion grounds.
As a character, she represents “the lower ruling the higher.”
Supposed to have been a sub-character to the bitter end, but could end up being the most popular of all if we’re not careful… is what the staff thought. Wait, that’s not right, hasn’t there always been blatant favoritism?
In reality, when development first started there wasn’t a route planned for Kohaku at all. What changed that, you ask? Well, after we released the Half-moon edition we read through the player feedback, and the one thing that almost everybody mentioned was that Kohaku needed a route too. So we caved to pressure and tacked it on at the very end.
Although she was a tragic heroine in *Tsukihime* itself, ever since then she’s just been running around letting off steam.
In *Kagetsu Tohya*, she gathered popularity as a mischievous housekeeper, and showed the first signs of her budding talent as a mad chemist. Her exploits included building a secret room in the Tohno mansion’s basement, wearing a hood and calling herself a magical girl, and even taking part in a bad end involving anesthetic drugs.
In *Melty Blood*, since she’s more-or-less the Kohaku from *Kagetsu Tohya* and not the one from *Tsukihime*, her magical-ness received an upgrade. Though the unbalanced Kohaku is nice, the carefree Kohaku from *Melty Blood* that does as she pleases is pretty nice too, don’t you think?
……This is a digression, but apparently there are a lot of users that have been completely defeated by Kohaku’s voice in *Melty Blood*. In fact, even the scenario writer was eviscerated.
