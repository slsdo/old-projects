A student enrolled at the Asagami Academy for Girls. Akiha is her roommate and mentor. Her tone of speech is incredibly stern, and she always tries to be as succinct as possible.
Her outward appearance is that of a petite, charming young girl, but according to Akiha she has the personality of a handsome man.
An unparalleled lover of rock music, she slips out of the dorms at least once a week to go to live shows at clubs.
However, she’s not a girl that’s cool like a man, she’s just a stylish girl.
She appears in *Kagetsu Tohya*, where she is the balance between her two roommates, Akiha and Hanepin. In the dorms she is secretly popular as a reliable but hard to talk to student, and despite her demeanor she is actually extremely caring.
Her parents’ home is a temple deep in the mountains of Nagano. As landlords of the entire region, they are also known as the “mountain kings.” Her love of rock music can be considered a form of rebellion against her family.
After graduating from high school, she plans to attend college while living together with Hanepin.
