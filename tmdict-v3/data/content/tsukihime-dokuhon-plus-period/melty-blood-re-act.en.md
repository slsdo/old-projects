An expansion to *Melty Blood*. Though various aspects of the game were tweaked and upgraded, the biggest change was probably the addition of Len and Satsuki as playable characters. Honestly, it’s more like an entirely new edition than an expansion.
The new arcade mode is similar to the ones in other fighting games, where each character is featured in their own short story. It’s a festival for the cast of *Tsukihime*, but one different than both *Kagetsu Tohya* and *Melty Blood*. Just think of it as a collection of fighting game exclusive bonus stories.
The game’s normal bosses are a bunch of scoundrels, and the hidden boss is… “that” person!
