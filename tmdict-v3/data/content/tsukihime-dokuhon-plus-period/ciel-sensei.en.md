Administrator of the Tsukihime Help Corner.
The fact that she fits even better here than in the main story is almost frightening. As for why it’s Ciel, well, basically we figured if we could turn an older-sister type character into the current Ciel, then turning the half-baked upperclassman Ciel into a teacher should be fine.
Since her partner Neco Arc made her solo debut in *Melty Blood Re-ACT*, there’s a part of her that wants to force her way onto the stage, too.
