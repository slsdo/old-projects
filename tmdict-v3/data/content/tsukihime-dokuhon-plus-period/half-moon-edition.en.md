The version of *Tsukihime* sold at the 2000 Summer Comiket. It was called the “Half-moon edition” because only the Arcueid and Ciel routes were included.
It’s become something of a rare item at this point, and it came bundled with various extras to sweeten the pot. For instance, a digital comic by Takeuchi, bonus artwork, a special trailer for the final release that would play after beating the Ciel route, a coupon for 500 yen off the final release, and a separate collection of setting material. Of course, the most notable thing it came with was a countless number of typos and omitted words.
