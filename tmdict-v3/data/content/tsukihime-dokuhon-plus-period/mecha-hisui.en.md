The Pleasant-type City Subjugation Weapon built by the mad doctor Magical Amber. A megadeus made to look like Hisui. Cast in the Name of God, Ye Not Guilty.
She is equipped with various armaments. Her primary motive force comes from her Magical Heart, while her secondary motive force is provided by a rubber band engine (like you’d use to launch a paper airplane). Without a doubt, this can be called a crystallization of super technology.
Though she is a mysterious, one-of-a-kind weapon completed by Kohaku after she became the Tatari, it appears that by *Re-ACT* she has entered mass-production.
…The giant Mecha Hisui that appears in her ending is something like a Mobile Armor, and the ending as a whole is a parody of Tetsujin 28-go.
During the development stage of *Re-ACT*, there were actually two versions of Mecha Hisui: Real Type and Super Type. The Super Type would have had stuff like a rocket punch, a super radio wave tornado, and even an erupting god finger. I really hate that we weren’t able to use it. Maybe next time!
