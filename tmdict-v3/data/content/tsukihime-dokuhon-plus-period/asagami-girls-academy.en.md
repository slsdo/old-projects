The private boarding school for girls that Akiha attends.
It is about an hour away from the Tohno mansion by car. Normally students are forced to live on campus, but Akiha has received special permission to commute to school from her own home. She actually did live in the school dorms when Shiki was living with the Arima, but it seems she forced the matter after he moved back into the Tohno mansion. Unfortunately, the oafish big brother didn’t notice his noble little sister’s efforts at all.
