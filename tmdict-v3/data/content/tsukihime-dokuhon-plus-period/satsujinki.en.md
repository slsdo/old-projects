The state when Shiki’s conscious mind goes blank due to the inversion impulse. Or, a possible future version of Tohno Shiki.
If there’s ever a *Tsukihime 2*, he’ll be a main character. Perhaps because the mystic eye killers alone have become unable to suppress his death perception, he’ll always have both eyes covered by bandages.
Though the Nanaya Shiki that appears in *Melty Blood* is close to this, properly speaking “Shiki the Killer” is something that should stem from “Tohno Shiki.”
