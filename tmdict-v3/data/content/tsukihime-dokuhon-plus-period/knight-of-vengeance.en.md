A knight that lives only for revenge. If there’s ever a *Tsukihime 2*, he’ll be one of the protagonists.
Of course, this refers to Enhance, one of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors. Because some part of him still exists as a human, the nerves in his right hand are destroyed every time he uses his demonic sword. Because he is a Dead Apostle, his left hand rots when he uses his Holy Burial Artillery Scripture.
It’s rumored that the one who performs maintenance on the Artillery Scripture is none other than the Church’s number one gun nut.
———Six vampires gathered in the English countryside in order to flush out the last True Ancestor. They were Dead Apostle Ancestors, one and all, bound by a pact of nonaggression. But little did they know that the Knight of Vengeance in their ranks was burning with ambition and treachery.
Suddenly, an ambush! It was the protector of the Princess, the god of death, Shiki the Killer. In order to further his own goals, the Knight of Vengeance had struck a deal with Shiki in private.
…Well, that’s what was in the preview trailer during the school festival in *Kagetsu Tohya*, anyway. In reality, even the staff has no idea if anything will ever come of it.
