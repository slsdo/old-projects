The foundation for setting up magecraft. There are two types, but here it refers to the quality within a human body that makes a magus a magus.
Magic circuits are responsible for converting life force into magical energy, and for connecting to the underlying grand magecraft formula.
Basically, magecraft is a formula that causes nature interference by starting up and stabilizing a “rule already established in the world” with magical energy. Or to put it another way, the “rule” is a car, and the “magical energy” is the gasoline that makes it run.
In order to activate magecraft, three things are required: the necessary amount of magical energy, a key (password/spell/code), and magic circuits to inject the magical energy into the “engine.”
If we assume for a moment that magical energy is electricity, then magic circuits would be both the reactor that produces that electricity, as well as the pipelines for running the system.
Because vital activity is indispensable to the operation of this reactor, there is a common misconception that a magus’ body = magic circuits. However, though quite rare, magic circuits that continue rotating on their own even after the practitioner’s vital activity has stopped do exist.
The reason that an individual’s magical energy (od) will be regenerated even if is totally used up is because the magic circuits are still operating. But on the other hand, without magic circuits, magical energy (od) will no longer be generated at all.
They are spread throughout the entire body as pseudo-nerves, and can basically be divided into cores, and pipes that connect these cores together. The pipes are similar to the synapses within the brain, constantly breaking off and reconnecting, but the cores never change.
Strictly speaking, these cores are the actual magic circuits.
They are considered to be a sort of internal organ, that will never increase or decrease in number. Of course, extracting and transplanting them is technically possible, but just like implanting an extra organ into a human body it should go without saying what will happen if you try it. Magic circuits, once lost, will never return.
As for what magi actually use these magic circuits for, well, that’s covered in a different story.
