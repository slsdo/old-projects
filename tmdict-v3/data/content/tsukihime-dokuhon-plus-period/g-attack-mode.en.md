A special bonus stage added in *Melty Blood Re-ACT*. Originally G-Akiha was a boss nobody but Shiki could fight, but in this mode you can enjoy fighting her with whatever character you like. For those of you that play Street Fighter, I suppose it’s something like Shin Akuma’s stage? The competition to see how fast you can beat it is really intense.
With possible combinations like G-Akiha versus Vermilion Akiha, it’s a world that doesn’t really make a lot of sense. My biggest regret is that we didn’t record any special lines for when you use Kohaku.
