Another name for Datura metel. Kohaku grows it in the back yard.
Despite being used for “that,” it was nonchalantly, earnestly, and boldly put on display.
By the way, when Kohaku said she wanted to grow some cacti as well, she was probably talking about Peyote. Watch out, Shiki! It’s another dangerous plant!
…Well, she really did start using cacti in *Melty Blood*. After *Kagetsu Tohya*, Kohaku established the “Magical Netherworld Psycho Garden” behind the Tohno mansion, which has been churning out ingredients for strange and eerie medicines ever since. T-This is bad! Somebody, stop her!
