Knight of the Shield. Captain of the Knights of the Inquisition led by the Holy Church. Female.
She participated in the failed subjugation of Wallachia alongside Sion, and faced Wallachia alone so that Sion could escape. Her fate afterward is unknown. She possesses the conceptual weapon “True Apocrypha Gamaliel,” a gun-shield that superficially resembles a large stringed instrument.
Though it seems Sion thought of her as reliable, they were torn apart before either of them realized they had become friends.
During Vampire Sion’s Last Arc, she attacks the enemy by recreating Riesbyfe’s information. Apparently, since Riesbyfe was swallowed up by the Tatari, she was transferred into Vampire Sion when she inherited its power.
Also, though there is apparently a nun with the same name working at a certain academy for girls, it is unknown if they are actually the same person or not.
