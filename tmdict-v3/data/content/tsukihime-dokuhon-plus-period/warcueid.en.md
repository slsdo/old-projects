Arcueid after going into a wild frenzy and becoming totally indiscriminate with her rage. “Evil” Arcueid.
You can catch a glimpse of this in the Ciel Route, though it seems she still had enough composure to recognize Shiki.
The Tatari Arcueid in *Melty Blood* is technically more akin to Arcueid in this state than to the Crimson Moon. Her attacks have become more monstrous due to her personality, and she revels in cruelty. She’s known for the way she shouts “Rip and tear, rip and tear!” as she pulls her enemies apart limb from limb with her own two hands. The root is the selfish princess Arcueid’s former royal manner of speech.
