A sub-heroine in *Tsukihime*. A servant working at the Tohno mansion. Sympath.
She is a maid who sports an apathetic expression and an inflexible attitude. Though she seems to be the exact opposite of her older sister Kohaku in that regard, if you look carefully you can see she’s actually demonstrating a wide variety of subtle expressions. Compared to Kohaku, who only ever wears an expression of “happiness,” Hisui actually seems much more human.
She has been working as a servant ever since she was taken in by the Tohno family as a child. After Shiki left the mansion, she began working there, and stopped talking to people of her own accord. Also, because of what Kohaku went through as a child, she forbade herself from leaving the mansion.
Though, perhaps it’s because her mental fortitude improved during the events of *Tsukihime*, but in *Kagetsu Tohya* she actually leaves the mansion of her own accord to bring Shiki his lunch.
She’s a bit ashamed of it, but it seems that even though she tries her best to maintain conduct befitting a servant when she’s in Shiki’s presence, every once in a while her true colors slip out.
Just as Kohaku is incapable of cleaning up inside, Hisui’s palate is hellishly out of sync with most people’s. It seems the reason she never cooks for Shiki is entirely because she doesn’t want to make him sad.
In the *Kagetsu Tohya* side story Imogirisou, she gets possessed by an evil spirit and demonstrates a strange form of martial arts. This was the inspiration for the Dark Jade Fist, her Arc Drive in *Melty Blood*.
Her super maid action in *Melty Blood* is a must see. The way her skirt flutters during her backdash is just… yeah.
