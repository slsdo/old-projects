No, not the black keys on a piano. The throwing swords wielded by Ciel.
As for why they’re called black keys, refer to the entry on purification.
Ciel carries a large number of these concealed on her person, but what’s under her robes is actually just the hilts. She materializes the blades by passing magical energy through pages of the bible. The maximum number she is able to conceal at one time is close to 100. Also, since black keys are designed specifically for throwing and not for swordplay, in a way they could be considered a kind of bullet.
Though they are counted as one of the basic weapons of the Church, the fact that they’re relatively hard to use means that very few executors favor them.
