The woman standing at the top of the Burial Agency. She’s not the same Narbareck that was talking to Roa, but it just so happens that the administrator of the Burial Agency is always a member of the same family. The current Narbareck is a homicidal maniac, and has shut herself away in the Burial Agency’s executive office.
…Well, it’s more like house arrest, really.
She regularly bullies all the members of the Burial Agency when they return from missions, and in turn they basically all wish she would just drop dead.
As the powerhouse whose job it is to reign in all the freaks in the Burial Agency, her infamy even reaches as far as the Association. Despite her young age, she is a monster that has already captured three of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors.
