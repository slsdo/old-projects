The Charging China Girl.
A young girl that uses pretend baji quan, and (secretly) idolizes Shiki as her big brother. Currently a sixth-grader in elementary school.
Shiki came to live in her house at around the same time she started to become aware of her surroundings, and it seems that for her it was something close to love at first sight. Ever since then, she has been spinning around in circles trying to figure out how to get closer to him.
Because she’s the kind of person that gets incredibly flustered when she’s with the person she likes, she was always at a loss for words around Shiki, and expressed her frustrations by tackling him. Before he knew it, head-butts to his solar plexus had become just another part of Shiki’s daily life. Though, after Shiki returned to the Tohno mansion it seems she was able to start talking a bit more.
In *Melty Blood*, she appears as a hidden character. Burning with a passion to bring back her big brother, she confronted the entire Tohno household on her own. It was one of *Melty Blood*’s comedy routes, the showdown to determine the strongest little sister…!!
Though normally she doesn’t have any actual battle ability, due to the Night of Wallachia’s influence her pretend baji quan ended up turning into the real thing. It was the debut of Miyako’s Amazing Baji Quan.
Her combination of a Chinese jacket with jean shorts made for a cute and wholesome outfit, but there were also rumors swirling around about “no pants” and “missing tights.” Maybe there’s even a rare win pose where she takes off her jacket?
