An inside joke. It became popular after the release of the Half-moon edition.
In that version of the game, Hisui had an odd habit of saying mind-reeling phrases like “I’ll accompany your room.” No matter how you look at it, she was definitely trying to brainwash poor Shiki.
Even the art director got in on it, and posted a picture of Hisui trying to brainwash Ciel on the Tsukihime BBS, which was cuter than you might expect.
“You are the culprit.”
Later, it was revived as Hisui’s Arc Drive in *Melty Blood*. Let’s confusion!
