Neco Arc’s killer move. J214A. She attacks horizontally by… turning into a rocket!
It seems that there may be some connection to the technique “Farewell, Ciel-sensei! Our friendship ended in the Crocodile Garden!” that appeared in Neco Arc’s command list in the third character popularity poll.
Also, this is totally unrelated, but all of Neco Arc’s techniques are extremely powerful. Something like the True Ancestor Beam can’t be fully observed with the naked eye. Of course, this technique is no exception—its fearsome effectiveness is seriously troublesome.
Incidentally, aren’t there crocodiles in the Great Cats Garden…?
