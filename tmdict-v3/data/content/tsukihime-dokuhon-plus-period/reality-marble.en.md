Intrinsic Bounded Field.
Originally referred to the alien common sense possessed by the beings called demons, but now also includes the unique boundary fields possessed by many people.
A subspecies of marble phantasm, it erodes reality and gives form to the user’s imagined world. It is the magecraft closest to magic, and a forbidden art within the Association.
Unlike marble phantasm, however, the form of a reality marble cannot be freely adjusted. It is the manifestation of the user’s one-and-only self, after all, so changing it with their will is impossible. On the other hand, since even things that are not part of nature can be influenced, perhaps it is actually even more amazing than marble phantasm, in a way.
Marble phantasm, which can change the world at will, but only has influence over elementals and nature. Reality marbles, whose form is limited in use to a single pattern, but force everything to submit to the user’s personal rules.
Both methods are similar yet different ways of changing the world, abilities that are extremely flexible yet limited in their own way.
…Properly speaking, reality marbles are only supposed to be used by elementals and demons, but given enough time it is possible for some advanced practitioners to complete a magecraft to give shape to their personal imagined world and create a reality marble of their own. Of course, if anything that isn’t an extension of nature like an elemental creates an alien world, the world itself will crush it. As a result, the upkeep of a reality marble requires a vast amount of energy, and most individuals are only capable of using one for a few minutes at a time.
It would seem that a majority of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors are capable of using reality marbles. Oh, and Nrvnqsr was able to escape the corrective influence of the world by using his reality marble within his own body. Way to go, Professor Chaos.
