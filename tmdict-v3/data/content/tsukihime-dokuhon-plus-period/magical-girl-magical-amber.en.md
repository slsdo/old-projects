The (fake) amber magician. A mysterious hooded girl. Her slogan is “Chemical! Magical! Medical!”
She appears as the guardian of the safe in *Kagetsu Tohya*, and also shows up while playing as Kohaku in *Melty Blood*. Ah, could there be some sort of connection between the two…!?
…In truth, she’s a broom girl, not a magical girl, but that’s neither here nor there.
Day after day, she throws herself into the manufacture of strange and suspicious drugs. She is a staff officer in the Tohno Mansion Basement Kingdom.
…Somehow, she seems like an even better fit for the Tatari than Sion, but the less said about that the better.
