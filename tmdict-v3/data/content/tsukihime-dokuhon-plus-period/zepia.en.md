A man who was head of the Eltnam family, famed within the Atlas Institute, one of the three great branches of the Association.
Though he was crowned with the name of Atlasia, he withdrew from the Association for a certain reason. Subsequently, the Eltnam family fell into decline.
The last anybody heard of him was 500 years ago, in Transylvania.
