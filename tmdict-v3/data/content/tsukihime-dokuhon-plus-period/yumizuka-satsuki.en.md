Shiki’s classmate. Her nickname is Sacchin.
She is a pitiable girl, who had been Shiki’s classmate several times since middle school, but never managed to capture his attention.
She just happened to catch sight of somebody who looked like Shiki walking through town one day, and because of that ended up being bitten by a vampire. Afterward, she stalked the town at night as a half vampire herself, her body and mind crumbling, until she encountered Shiki and met her end.
Basically, your typical tragic heroine. She remained unrewarded to the bitter end, but I’d like to believe she at least received a fleeting salvation in her last moments.
As it happens, she had an exceptional predisposition for being a vampire. The fact that she was able to operate as a Dead Apostle less than a day after being bitten is totally unheard of. That she was only able to discover her talents after death… it’s a little ironic, no? Exactly what you’d expect from the shadow heroine Sacchin.
Still, at her core she’s a normal girl. Though she might be on the same level as the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors as far as pure suitability is concerned, since her personality is still human it seems that she’s doomed to be an eternal dropout.
In *Melty Blood Re-ACT*, she participates as a usable character for the first time, allowing players to enjoy situations that were impossible in the original story. Sion is her pen-pal and fellow back-alley dweller. It’s a relationship based on the assumption that Satsuki was still alive when Sion first came to Japan.
The reason she doesn’t have the corpse-throwing killer move that she demonstrated in *Tsukihime* is because the Satsuki in *Re-ACT* has still never killed anybody. Perhaps if there’s ever a “full vampire” version of Satsuki, though, it will make an appearance as well?
