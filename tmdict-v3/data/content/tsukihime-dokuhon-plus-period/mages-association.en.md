An organization created to protect those who seek to learn magecraft, regardless of nationality or field of study. (On paper, anyway.)
Their mission is the management, concealment, and advancement of magecraft.
In order to protect themselves from that which would threaten them (be it the Church, rival organizations of magi, or the monstrosities that punish humans who break taboos), they accumulated military might.
In order to further the advancement (degeneration) of magecraft, they built research facilities.
And, in order to deter crimes committed with magecraft, they created laws.
Their headquarters is located in London, and goes by the unofficial name of “The Clock Tower.”
It seems that in the beginning the Association was divided into three great branches, including the original associations that predate the Clock Tower. That is, the “Giant’s Pit” of Egypt, and a cluster of associations based in northern Europe called the “Sea of Estray.” However, ever since the Clock Tower became the headquarters, mingling between the branches has been on the decline.
Also, they are fundamentally incompatible with the magecraft foundation of the Middle East and the ideological magecraft of mainland China, and the three groups are currently feigning nonaggression.
Sion is a member of the Giant’s Pit, also known as the Atlas Institute.
