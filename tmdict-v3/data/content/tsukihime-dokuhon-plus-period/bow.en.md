Ciel’s alias within the Burial Agency. The name comes from the fact that she’s the only person in the Burial Agency that fights using firearms.
It seems that Ciel is something of a gunpowder maniac, and the entire reason she changed the Seventh Holy Scripture into its current form was just to fit her own personal tastes. …Sure, shooting a gun feels nice and all, but I’m a little worried about her. I wonder if there’s something strange at work stressing her out…?
Also, in *Melty Blood* she finally demonstrates skills worthy of this name. So many black keys…
