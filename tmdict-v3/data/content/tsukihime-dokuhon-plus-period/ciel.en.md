One of the heroines in *Tsukihime*. A mysterious upperclassman. At the beginning of the game, she planted a suggestion in both Shiki and the players’ heads that she was just an ordinary, strangely named senpai that they already knew. Also, glasses.
In truth, she is the newest member of the Church’s inquisition force, the Burial Agency, and is tasked with punishing the Dead Apostle Roa. She infiltrated Shiki’s school because she suspected him of being Roa’s reincarnation, but in the process of observing him she ended up being charmed by him instead. It wasn’t something as simple as falling in love, of course. It’s just that she was moved by the fact that Shiki could lead such a carefree life despite having experienced death just like she had.
Due to a certain contradiction, she is an existence that cannot die no matter what happens. She is trying to destroy Roa in order to resolve this state of affairs.
She boasts excellent reflexes, and is number seven in the Burial Agency despite her young age. She’s not just skilled in martial arts, though. The knowledge of magecraft that she inherited from Roa is equivalent to that possessed by a magus of the rank of Grand—the highest rank in the Association. Even in the Church, where magecraft is officially forbidden, this is regarded as a highly useful asset. However, Ciel herself hates drawing on Roa’s knowledge.
Within the Burial Agency she is known as “Bow,” due to her preference for using projectile weapons. She fights using all sorts of projectiles—not just throwing swords, but guns as well. In fact, the one responsible for changing the Seventh Holy Scripture from a beast’s horn into its current shape was actually Ciel.
Before she was part of the Burial Agency, she was the daughter of a baker. Her dream was to become a cake maker, and she already had some skill at making sweets.
…Though it seems she has no interest in making Western-style sweets anymore, on account of it dredges up memories of the past.
Her reputation as a curry lover has grown with each successive appearance, and at this point her name itself is synonymous with the stuff. As for why she loves curry so much, Takeuchi made a manga about it. It’s probably about half true.
Always seems to end up playing second-fiddle to the other heroines. Maybe it’s because of her magnanimous, all-forgiving nature?
Oh, well, at least her hand-to-hand combat action in *Melty Blood* ended up being really cool, since she was conceived of as a battle-type heroine from the very start.
