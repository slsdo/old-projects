An essential element for invoking magecraft. Also known as the primordial animus, and life itself.
It is broadly divided into two types: the greater magical energy (mana), which is the breath of the planet filling the world and nature, and the lesser magical energy (od), which is possessed by living beings (humans).
As far as quality is concerned, they are both essentially identical. The only difference is that the amount of mana in the world far, far exceeds the amount of od.
Because mana is the magical energy of “that space” which fills the atmosphere, magi can use it freely.
…Of course, the amount that can be utilized directly corresponds to the capacity of the magus—which is to say, the number of magic circuits they have.
