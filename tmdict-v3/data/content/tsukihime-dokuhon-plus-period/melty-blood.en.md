A fighting game set after *Tsukihime*, jointly developed by Watanabe Seisakusho (French Bread) and Type-Moon. It was the first time Tsukihime had voices.
It is the story of a certain vampire and a night of lies, during a summer different than the one in *Kagetsu Tohya*. The stage progression is in the style of Darius. It seems that a fighting game that advances in such a manner had been something the scenario writer always wanted. Take the upper paths and you’ll be treated to a serious story, while the lower paths quickly spiral into absurdity.
The game’s subtitle is “Hologram Summer, Night on the Blood Liar.” The original plan was for it to be about an executor who was a sort of rival to Ciel appearing to fight Arcueid, but once production started the sample game ended up being so amazing we felt the need to whip up a worthy story within “Tsukihime Canon” to match.
Of course, with a new heroine, one of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors, and even Arima Miyako, it was packed full of fan service, too. So, thank you, Watanabe Seisakusho! The amount of freedom as a fighting game is just great, and the mobility of the characters is off the charts. I hope everybody out there enjoys the pixel-art *Tsukihime* characters as much as we do!
