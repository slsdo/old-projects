Arcueid’s familiar. A succubus. Normally found hanging around Arcueid in the form of a black cat.
She is a succubus that can enter other people’s dreams, and is responsible for causing the wet dream Shiki had about Arcueid, Ciel, Akiha, or Hisui.
She does not appear in the original work, but her outward appearance is that of a young girl of about ten years old. She has calm expressions, and wears a black coat with a big ribbon in her hair. It’s no exaggeration to say that her charm is enough to completely overshadow the other heroines.
She appears as a guest heroine in Kagetsu Tohya.
…Well, she wasn’t so much a guest as she was the core of the story, actually.
Though at first it may seem that she is unable to speak, her voice box is intact and she can understand human language. Apparently she has simply decided not to talk for some reason. In *Re-ACT*, she only has a single spoken line.
Also, her pixel art in *Re-ACT* is, in a word, amazing. If she had a voice to match, she’d probably be able to conquer the entire world.
Because she never talks, it’s hard to really understand her personality, but basically she’s the type that likes to quietly spend her time alone. Just like a cat, she is haughty and fickle, but prone to sudden bursts of attention-seeking craziness as well.
