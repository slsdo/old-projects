The vampire pursuing Arcueid. One of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors.
The factors of 666 beasts are swirling around within his body, though it may be easier to think of it as him being equipped with 666 familiars. Because this is essentially like having 666 lives, properly speaking even a serious Arcueid wouldnâ€™t be able to kill him. Also, as one who became a Dead Apostle through magecraft, he has absolutely no interest in territory or building a faction. The only thing he cares about is completing his thesis.
Despite his huge, muscular body, he is still a scholar at heart, and becomes extremely agitated when he runs into a situation he cannot understand. As a result, he lost his cool in his battle against Shiki and ended up recklessly charging at him. Perhaps due to his abilities, he is becoming more and more apathetic and indifferent toward everything. Should he continue to live for another several hundred years, odds are he really will end up degrading into nothing more than a mass of chaos.
When he was still a human, his name was Fabro Rowan. He was a magus hailing from the Wandering Tomb, located in the northern Sea of Estray.
