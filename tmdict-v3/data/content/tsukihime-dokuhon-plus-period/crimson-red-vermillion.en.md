The name for when those with inhuman heritage have drawn out their dormant blood to the maximum possible extent. Once they reach this state, they are enveloped in a mirage-like haze and can never return to being human.
The name Crimson Red Vermilion is unique to the families ruled over by the Tohno household. Elsewhere, it is known as Ancestral Return.
As one with particularly tainted blood, the possibility that Akiha will become a Crimson Red Vermilion is high. In *Tsukihime*, when her hair turned deep crimson, she was on the verge of this, though somehow she managed to bring her human and oni blood under control. Of course, rather than returning to how she was before, it’s more accurate to say she switched to her “human” self while remaining close to the Crimson Red Vermilion state.
