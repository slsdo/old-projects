A student at the Asagami Academy for Girls. Her pet name is “Ika.”
She was an honor student gifted with both intelligence and beauty, capable of accomplishing anything she put her mind to. However, she fell into the grips of obsession with the appearance of the brilliant Tohno Akiha, who outshone even her.
She appears in one of the side stories in *Kagetsu Tohya*. Perhaps because her timidity and feeling of being cornered were pretty cute, very few players actually ended up disliking her.
Also, she still couldn’t stop herself from quivering in Akiha’s presence even after the incident was resolved, but she did her best to muster her courage and resist the urge to run away.
