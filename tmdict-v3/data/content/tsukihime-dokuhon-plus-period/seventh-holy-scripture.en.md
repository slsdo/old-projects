The conceptual armament that Ciel is authorized to carry. An iron hammer created by the Church in order to renounce the heretical doctrine of reincarnation.
It was created by felling a miraculous beast said to consume souls, then using its horn as a key. The surface of the horn is inscribed with tightly-packed complaints about how “reincarnation is really lame.”
Since it’s been almost a thousand years since it was first created, it even has an elemental living within it.
It was sanctified over the course of many years, but eventually fell into Ciel’s hands.
“A horn!? That’s not practical at all. The higher-ups are totally out of touch!”
Unable to hold herself back, she set about improving it, and because of that the Scripture’s elemental ended up having the essence of its personality warped.
Before Ciel remodeled it, it was only effective against spiritual entities. Now, however, it has been transformed into a lump of iron that can pound a vampire to death with its physical attack power alone. It has a gross weight of 60 kilograms, and a maximum weight of twice that with optional attachments. It’s a… Gatling scripture!?
