The protagonist of *Kara no Kyoukai*. Able to see lines of death, just like Tohno Shiki.
She wears a traditional kimono paired with a leather jacket and high-laced boots. Though she always carries a knife, her true talent is with the katana.
The last name “Ryougi” and first name “Shiki” both have an appropriate meaning. Consequently as a user of the mystic eyes of death perception it can be said she is several ranks higher than Tohno Shiki, who is pretty much her polar opposite. In fact, his personality is actually close to Kokutou Mikiya’s.
For more details on this Shiki, please consult *Kara no Kyoukai*.
