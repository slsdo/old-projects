Eldest son of the Kishima. However, because the Kishima family itself has already died out, he is treated as the family head.
He was summoned by Tohno Makihisa to be his trump card in wiping out the Nanaya, and delivered results far beyond his expectations.
For Shiki, who subconsciously remembers the scenes of devastation from that time, Kouma has become a nigh insurmountable image of death.
With grip strength powerful enough crush enormous trees in his hands, inborn agility, and strange oni powers, he annihilates his enemies without mercy. Truly, he is an oni symbolic of scorching heat and burning flames.
Currently still alive.
