Eldest son of the Nanaya, a clan of demon hunters that passed down psychic power as their genetic inheritance.
The Nanaya had retired from the demon hunting trade to live a quiet life in the mountains. However, because Tohno Makihisa still regarded them as dangerous, they were raided and completely wiped out.
Shiki, too, was very nearly killed by Makihisa, but somehow he narrowly escaped death and was taken in by the Tohno family as an adopted child.
Though Shiki himself does not remember anything from when he lived in the Nanaya village, he did receive basic training before Makihisa’s attack. This training was responsible for turning Shiki into a transcendent killer every time he was backed into a corner during *Tsukihime*… somehow.
In *Melty Blood*, Nanaya Shiki appears as Tohno Shiki’s anxieties given form. He uses the Nanaya martial arts that Shiki should have learned, but unlike Shiki he does not possess the mystic eyes of death perception. According to Miyako, he is her “wild big brother.” Also, perhaps it is due to Wallachia’s influence, but he is prone to somewhat theatrical elocution.
