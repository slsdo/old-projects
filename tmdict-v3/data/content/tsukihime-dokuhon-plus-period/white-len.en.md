Len’s shadow. She is Len’s unused “active personality” given form using the remnants of Wallachia. The “her” that exists on the other side of the mirror, so to speak.
In *Melty Blood Re-ACT*, she appears as a boss. Her stage, Midsummer Snowfield, could be called Len’s imagined world. Compared to the normal Len, she is crueler, more vulgar, and ever-so-loveable. She is a contradictory idol, both sensual and chaste. Because the Midsummer Snowfield is Len’s world, she is the master of everything in it. Nevertheless, it is completely at the mercy of White Len’s power. The version of her Arc Drive that uses the snowfield isn’t much to look at, but I could listen to that cute voice over and over.
By the way, this is just a digression but *Re-ACT*’s subtitle is actually “Through the Looking-Glass.”
