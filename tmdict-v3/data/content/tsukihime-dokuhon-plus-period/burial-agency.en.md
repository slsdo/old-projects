The Holy Church’s expert inquisitors.
Not exorcists who cast out devils, but executors who strike them down.
A perfect meritocracy, as anybody with the ability to dispose of those things the Church finds inconvenient can become a member.
…Well, it seems they’ll baptize you when you join, and the pay isn’t too bad either. The agency is composed of seven members including Narbareck, and one reserve member making for a total of eight.
They always work alone, and under no circumstances will they cooperate with the demon hunters of other countries. As they possess absolute authority, there are times when they will defy even the wishes of the Church itself to stamp out heresy. For instance, even if it’s an archbishop, if he has been possessed by a devil they have the power and authority to skewer him on the spot. It’s no wonder, then, that there are whispers within the Church that the agency itself is a heresy.
Arcueid often receives requests from the Church, and has cooperated with them on numerous occasions to exterminate Dead Apostles. Nevertheless, if she ever showed even the slightest opening, the Burial Agency would move to seal her without a second thought.
Also, two of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors, Merem Solomon and El Nahat, are cooperating with them. Though it looks as if they are both being forced to do so, the true reasons for that are unknown.
