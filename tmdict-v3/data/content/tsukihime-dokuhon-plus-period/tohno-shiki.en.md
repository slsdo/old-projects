The protagonist of *Tsukihime*. Afflicted with chronic anemia. Mister Glasses.
He is the kind of character that makes both friends and enemies without realizing it. His habit of collecting edged weapons is probably a trait left over from the “other” Shiki, from *Kara no Kyoukai*. Taking his glasses off for every single event CG is his charm point.
An unfortunate boy, who suffered through various ordeals in *Tsukihime*, was dragged into strange situations in *Kagetsu Tohya*, and had a terrible time in *Melty Blood*.
Because he lived true to his promise with Aozaki Aoko to “become a man in the manner he thinks is right,” he developed into a good and upright person, but at his core he is actually comparatively cold-hearted. Or rather, no matter what happens, good or bad, he simply accepts it as it is. In a sense, this reckless way of life is similar to that of a hermit who has retired from society.
