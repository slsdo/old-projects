Kohaku’s Arc Drive. After changing into Chinese clothes, she unleashes a vaguely familiar series of techniques. The mock China feeling here is out of this world.
During Blood Heat even more hits are added to the combination, but since this rampaging style is too violent there’s a real chance she’ll be fired after using it… maybe. Sorry, Kohaku.
The inspiration for this technique was *Kagetsu Tohya*, when Kohaku came to Shiki’s school festival and wore a Chinese silk dress in his class’s event.
