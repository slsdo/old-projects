The Pleasant-type City Subjugation Weapon built by the mad doctor Magical Amber. A weaponized robot made to look like Hisui.
She is equipped with various armaments. Her primary motive force comes from her Magical Heart, while her secondary motive force is provided by a rubber band engine. Without a doubt, this is the crystallization of super technology—a mysterious weapon completed by Kohaku after she became the Tatari.
The enormous Mecha Hisui that appears in her ending is a Strategic Land Subjugation model. There shouldn’t have been more than one built in *Re-act*, but for some reason it seems that in *Act-Cadenza* there’s already a mass-production infrastructure in place…
They have a tendency to receive version upgrades every time *Melty Blood* itself does. Could there be yet another new model of Mecha Hisui under construction in the underground factory beneath the Tohno mansion even now…?
