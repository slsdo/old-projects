A name attached to all of Yumizuka Satsuki’s various throwing skills. (“Sacchin” is a pet name for Satsuki.)
“Grasping the Unfinished Dream” is a ground attack. The A version is most effective in combos, while the B version is best used against stunned opponents.
“Chasing the Unreachable Dream” is an anti-air attack. The EX version’s hitbox, attack power, and ability to lead into combos are all amazing. I’d even go so far as to say that building up the gauge just to use this move is the proper way of playing Sacchin.
Maybe in the next version of the game we’ll add a third kind of throwing skill. How does an air-to-ground attack called “Picking Up the Fallen Dream” sound?
