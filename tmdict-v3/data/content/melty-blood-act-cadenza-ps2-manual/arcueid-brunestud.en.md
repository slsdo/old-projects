Royalty of the True Ancestors. The Last Princess.
Though she has no ties to Japan herself, she came to Misaki in pursuit of a certain vampire.
She is a True Ancestor, born in the 12th Century for the sole purpose of hunting those True Ancestors that had fallen and become demon lords. She was originally an existence with no use for emotions, but after meeting (being killed by) Tohno Shiki her state of mind changed dramatically. It’s similar to a broken machine that just isn’t quite the same when you put it back together, probably. (Of course, that’s leaving aside the question of whether or not she gained a new function or lost an old one…)
At any rate, the pure and noble vampire princess was, through some mistake, reborn as a carefree, airheaded funny vamp.
As the bastard child of the planet, her powers are totally ridiculous. Even sunlight just makes her feel a little listless, and the source of her energy supply is the earth itself.
