A congregation of heroines forced to live in back alleys. Right now, Yumizuka Satsuki and Sion are the only official members, though sometimes White Len stops by as well.
In *Tsukihime*, back alleys were a terrifying place full of corpses, where girls that should have been dead chased you down and cornered you, and classmates hid their blood-drenched arms. However, it seems that ever since the BAA was founded, safety in the alleys has improved remarkably.
