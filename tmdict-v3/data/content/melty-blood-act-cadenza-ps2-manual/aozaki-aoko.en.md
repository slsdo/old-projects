One of the five existing magicians.
Though she is the legitimate heir of the “distinguished” Aozaki household, she’s currently wandering around the world with a single trunk in hand. Her magecraft attribute is one specialized for breaking things, so she’s not very good at healing, construction, and restoration sorceries. Known as the “Witch of Destruction,” she’s not particularly versatile, but is second to none when it comes to busting out of hopeless situations.
It was due to her influence that the young Tohno Shiki was able to grow up normally despite being burdened with abnormal eyes. Therefore to him, she is an existence akin to a respected former teacher.
