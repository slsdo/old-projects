The older of the twin sisters working as servants in the Tohno mansion.
An energetic girl, that always sports a bright, unwavering smile. In *Tsukihime*, she was the servant assigned to Akiha, and was in charge of cooking, tending to the gardens, and managing the finances of the estate.
In contrast to her natural cheerfulness, she also has an extremely cool-headed and objective point of view that even she herself is not aware of.
She was an orphan brought in to the Tohno mansion together with Hisui. She has the bad habit of teasing her master, Akiha, even as she looks after her.
Furthermore, she is a skilled pharmacist, and often lends her aid to the anemia-prone Shiki. Though she is indeed well-versed in strange medicines due to her job, that fact was exaggerated by the Tatari, leading to her appearance as the extremely mysterious Magical Doctor Kohaku in *Melty Blood*.
