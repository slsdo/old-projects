Len’s cat-summoning technique. There are four varieties: brown, black, grey, and orange tabby. The A version of the technique summons the brown or orange cat, while the B version of the technique summons the black or grey cat. Also, as an aside, the grey cat is the ultimate cat, capable even of pushing back Nrvnqsr’s Arc Drive.
As a succubus, Len has no inherent ability to employ cats as minions or anything like that. They are simply cooperating out of a sense of good will. It seems that Len, who was created from a black cat, can understand the language of cats.
The inspiration for this technique comes from the scene in *Kagetsu Tohya* where you first encounter Len in the park. The name of that event was “Len Covered In Cats.”
Also, the C version of the technique summons some sort of cat-like organism that flies off into the sky. Though its majestic figure is reminiscent of mankind’s first functional rocket, the V-2, the truth is it’s a pretty useless move.
