Vampires. Basically, humans that have by some means or another been transformed into bloodsuckers.
Originally they were emergency meals prepared by the True Ancestors, to use when they became unable to control their vampiric impulse. In a sense, you could say they were a type of pain-killer.
Humans who had their blood sucked by the True Ancestors would in turn be transfigured into similar bloodsuckers themselves, and forced to spend their now immortal lives serving as the True Ancestors’ emergency rations. Without a doubt, they were a “company of the dead.”
However, whereas the True Ancestors’ desire to drink blood is purely mental, the Dead Apostles need to drink blood to maintain their bodies. Or to put it another way, for the True Ancestors it is merely entertainment, while for the Dead Apostles it is a fundamental aspect of their survival similar to breathing.
At some point, after sucking the blood of others for such a long time, the Dead Apostles began to feel a sense of superiority from the very act of sucking blood itself. They strengthened their abilities, their will, and eventually escaped from the control of the True Ancestors into the world of man, where they repeated the act of drinking blood over and over again to maintain their existences.
This is the origin of the bloodsuckers formed from humans, the Dead Apostles.
The Dead Apostles that escaped the True Ancestors the earliest are known as the 27 Ancestors. Though some of those 27 have been replaced over the generations, there are also those that still reign as Ancestors even now.
