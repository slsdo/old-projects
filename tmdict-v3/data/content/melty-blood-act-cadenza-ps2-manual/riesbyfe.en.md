Knight of the Shield. Captain of the Knights of the Inquisition led by the Holy Church.
She participated in the subjugation of the Tatari three years ago, and faced Wallachia alone so that Sion could escape. Her fate afterward is unknown. She possesses the conceptual weapon “True Apocrypha Gamaliel,” a gun-shield that superficially resembles a large stringed instrument.
Though it seems Sion thought of her as reliable, they were torn apart before either of them realized they had become friends.
During Vampire Sion’s Last Arc, she attacks the enemy by recreating Riesbyfe’s information. Apparently, since Riesbyfe was swallowed up by the Tatari, she was transferred into Vampire Sion when she inherited its power.
Properly speaking, because everything swallowed by the Tatari is reconfigured as equivalent data, things that can be recreated separately from the Tatari like Riesbyfe are rare. Presumably, it’s due to the presence of the True Apocrypha, acting as a shield and slowing her absorption.
