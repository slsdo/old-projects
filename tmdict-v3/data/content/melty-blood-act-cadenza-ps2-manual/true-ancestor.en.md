A singular existence amongst the bloodsuckers. Characteristically close to elementals.
They were created by the planet, which had no tangible method of self-defense against humans. Because of this, it could be said that they are nature’s sense of touch. However, there was a birth defect. The True Ancestors bore a flaw, the vampiric impulse.
Each and every True Ancestor is burdened with the desire to drink the blood of the very humans they were meant to rule. And, in order to suppress that impulse, they consume their own willpower. Those that can change the state of the world merely be thinking are instead forced to use almost all of those “thoughts” to restrain themselves.
But, everything has a limit. Unable to resolve the problem at its root, the vampiric impulse accumulates, until finally it becomes impossible for them to control with their power alone. True Ancestors that have become unable to control their desires fall into an eternal slumber. It could be said that this is the lifespan of those who have no end.
Year by year their numbers dwindled, until by the time Arcueid was born in the 12th Century, only a hundred individuals remained.
Also, there were those among them that succumbed to their desires and began indiscriminately drinking human blood. Known as Fallen Ancestors (Demon Lords), they are powerful to the point that it is said to be completely impossible for humans to oppose them.
