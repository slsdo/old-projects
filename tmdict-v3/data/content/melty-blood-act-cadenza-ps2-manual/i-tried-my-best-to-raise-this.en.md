The name of the technique where Kohaku whips out various bizarre plants.
Kohaku is in charge of managing the Tohno mansion’s gardens, but she also cultivates her own secret garden as a hobby. Though originally it was created for the sake of making medicine, due to the influence of the Tatari there was an outbreak of strange monsters. It goes by the name of Kohaku’s Psycho Garden.
Incidentally, this garden is also where Kohaku’s various <span style="text-decoration:line-through";>chemicals</span> magical drugs are manufactured.
