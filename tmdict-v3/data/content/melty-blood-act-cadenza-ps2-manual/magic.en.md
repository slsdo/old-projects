A mystery distinct from magecraft. The final destination of magi.
“Magic” is that which makes the impossible into the possible, for a given era. A “result” which can be realized with the application of time and effort is not magic. In the past, when civilization was young, most magi were also magicians, but currently only five remain.
Each particular magic is named by its number: i.e., the First, the Second, and so on. Aozaki Aoko is the user of the Fifth magic.
