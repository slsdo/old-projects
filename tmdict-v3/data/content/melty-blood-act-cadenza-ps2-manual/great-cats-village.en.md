The mysterious, unearthly kingdom of cats. Also known as the GCV. An underground kingdom that is both everywhere in this world, and nowhere.
Its size is constantly fluctuating from village to cottage to company, but in the end itâ€™s basically a village. There are some that say it is the dream of a certain mighty cat.
