Arcueid’s Last Arc.
For just a second, it is possible to catch a glimpse of the vampire princess Arcueid’s true power. The phantom that appears behind her back is her original form. Its appearance, abilities, and very thoughts could be called the Crimson Moon.
The inspiration for this technique comes from Kagetsu Tohya. Specifically, the episode where Shiki strayed off into Arcueid’s dream and received proper retribution for killing her. Because of that, when this technique is used on Shiki it hits eighteen times.
