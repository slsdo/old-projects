Tohno Akiha’s Arc Drive.
For just a moment, she fully unleashes her power and “plunders” the opponent. The reason her hair turns red is because her true nature is shining through.
At one point in *Tsukihime*, the schoolhouse was totally covered in red threads, making escape impossible for the prey trapped within. Without a doubt, that was Origami. The outlandish spectacle from that time makes its reappearance during Tohno Akiha’s Last Arc.
