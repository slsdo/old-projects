A weapon created to go beyond mere physical interference, and exert influence on concepts, natural providence, and space.
For instance, something that nullifies ”eternal youth“ by overwriting it with the idea of ”natural lifespan.“
Ciel’s Seventh Holy Scripture contains the dual concepts of “reincarnation criticism” and “eternity without permanence.”
By the way, after being killed by Shiki, Arcueid had at first mistakenly assumed that he must possess some kind of powerful conceptual armament.
