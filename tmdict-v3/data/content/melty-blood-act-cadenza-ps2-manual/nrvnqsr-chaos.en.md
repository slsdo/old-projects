One of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors. Alias, Chaos. He uses all the creatures of the earth as familiars. Because of the fact that he is preserving even extinct species, he is also sometimes called Dr. Beast.
Though he had no business in Japan, he was selected as the executor of the True Ancestor hunt proposed by the White Wing Lord, and followed Arcueid to the island nation in order to defeat her.
Dead Apostles who can measure their lives in millennia require a colossal amount of energy. This has nothing to do with their strength—it is merely the compensation required to maintain such a long-lived existence. Because he is one of these millennium-class Dead Apostles himself, Nrvnqsr’s appetite is voracious. It took devouring every single person in a ten story hotel just to satisfy him.
The factors of 666 beasts are swirling around within his body, but it’s probably alright just to think of it as him being equipped with 666 familiars. Because this is essentially like having 666 lives, properly speaking he’s a Dead Apostle that even a serious Arcueid wouldn’t be able to kill.
As one who became a Dead Apostle through magecraft, he has absolutely no interest in territory or building a faction. The only thing he cares about is completing his thesis.
When he was still a human, his name was Fabro Rowan. He was a magus hailing from the Wandering Tomb, located in the northern Sea of Estray, one of the three main branches of the Association.
