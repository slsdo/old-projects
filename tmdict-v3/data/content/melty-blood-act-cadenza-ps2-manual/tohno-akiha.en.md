Tohno Shiki’s younger sister, and the Tohno family’s heir.
She has long black hair and a dignified posture, firm speech, and an unendearing personality. On top of that, her love of strict discipline can make her somewhat hard to get along with.
Perhaps it’s because she doesn’t think much of the way Shiki lived doing whatever he pleased for eight years, but she lashes out at him every chance she gets. Though she is basically straightforward and honest at her core, she is also unyielding and hates losing, so her true personality rarely gets a chance to shine.
She saved Shiki’s life when they were young, and has absolute faith in him even if she’d never admit it.
She lived in the dorms at the Asagami Academy for Girls after Shiki left for the Arima household, but she started commuting from home when he returned to the Tohno mansion.
As the Tohno family head she possesses noble blood, and her power as a demon hybrid is among the best of the best. If Arcueid is a Western vampire, then Akiha would be an example of an Eastern vampire.
The embodiment of “plundering,” all who enter her field of vision will have their heat (life force) stolen from them, no questions asked.
