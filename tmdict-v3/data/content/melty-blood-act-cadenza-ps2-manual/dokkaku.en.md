Single Horn. The name of the martial art practiced by Kishima Kouma.
Like the monk who attains enlightenment on his own, it is solitary. Which is to say, it is a martial art that can only be passed down to “one like oneself.” In this case, that refers to the Kishima family of oni hybrids.
If the Nanaya martial arts are something that can be inherited by any four-legged beast, then the Kishima martial arts are something that can only be learned by the Kishima.
