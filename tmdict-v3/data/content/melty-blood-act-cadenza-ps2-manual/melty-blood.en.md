The title of this work. A series of fighting games based on the visual novel *Tsukihime*.
The first game, *Melty Blood*, was the story of the summer one year after *Tsukihime*. Rumors of vampires once again began to swirl around Misaki, followed soon after by the appearance of the beautiful Sion.
The second game, *Re-act*, was a bonus chapter with *Melty Blood* as its base. After the Tatari matter was taken care of, White Len used its power to create a single night of dreams. It was a fighting game with an all-star cast.
This third game, *Act-Cadenza*, is a further expanded version of *Re-act*, where nearly everybody that appeared in *Tsukihime* gets to take on a leading role.
