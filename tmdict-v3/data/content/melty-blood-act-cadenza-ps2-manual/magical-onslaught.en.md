A name for all the dubious techniques used by Kohaku.
Though they’re called things like Magical Attack and Magical Missile, no matter how you look at them they’re chemical weapons. It just goes to show, there’s nothing good about the “magical” stuff in *Melty Blood*.
If the series continues, chances are even more magical armaments will make their appearance. There might even be a magic wand equipped with a dangerous and crafty artificial intelligence…
