Arcueid’s familiar. A succubus. Normally found hanging around Arcueid in the form of a black cat.
A guest heroine in *Kagetsu Tohya*, she was the one responsible for creating the eternally looping day. She is a succubus that can enter other people’s dreams, and due to various events is currently living at both the Tohno mansion and Arcueid’s apartment.
In short, Arcueid is her contractual master, while Shiki is the master she chose herself.
Though at first it may seem that she is unable to speak, her voice box is intact and she can understand human language. Apparently she has simply decided not to talk for some reason.
