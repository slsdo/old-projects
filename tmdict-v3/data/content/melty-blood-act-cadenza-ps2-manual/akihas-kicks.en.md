There are various kick techniques found in Tohno Akiha’s list of normal skills. It is a tomboyishness unbecoming of a young lady from a respectable family.
For example, 5C’s Miss “Current Family Head” Kick, 6C’s Miss “Yakuza” Kick, J2C’s Miss “Divine Punishment Is Swift” Kick, etc.
So far, many different kicks have been demonstrated. Please expect more of them in the future.
