The protagonist of *Tsukihime*. He is an extraordinarily ordinary young man who possesses the mystic eyes of death perception.
Eight years ago (nine years ago counting from *Melty Blood*), he received a massive chest wound in a traffic accident, but miraculously revived. After recovering, however, he developed chronic anemia, and so was sent to live with the Arima family by his father Makihisa.
He is the kind of character that makes both friends and enemies without realizing it.
Because he lived true to his promise with Aozaki Aoko to “become a man in the manner he thinks is right,” he developed into a good and upright person. Perhaps because of his ability to see death all around him, he has a comparatively farsighted view of things. No matter what happens, he just takes it in stride. Que sera, sera.
A peculiar type of superhero who’s basically benign, but if you approach him with the intent to cause him harm he’ll destroy you.
