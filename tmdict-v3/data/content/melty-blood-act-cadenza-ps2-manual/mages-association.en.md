An organization created to protect those who seek to learn magecraft, regardless of nationality or field of study. (On paper, anyway.)
Their mission is the management, concealment, and advancement of magecraft.
In order to protect themselves from that which would threaten them (be it the Church, rival organizations of magi, or the monstrosities that punish humans who break taboos), they accumulated military might.
In order to further the advancement (degeneration) of magecraft, they built research facilities.
And, in order to deter crimes committed with magecraft, they created laws.
Their headquarters is located in London, and goes by the unofficial name of “The Clock Tower.”
