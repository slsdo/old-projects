Ciel’s Arc Drive.
The conceptual armament that Ciel is authorized to carry. Although it is called a scripture, it’s actually an enormous pile bunker.
An iron hammer created by the Church in order to renounce the heretical doctrine of reincarnation. Over a millennium has passed since it was first forged, and there’s even an elemental dwelling within it, but…
Before Ciel remodeled it, it was only effective against spiritual entities. Now, however, it has been transformed into a lump of iron that can pound a vampire to death with its physical attack power alone. It has a gross weight of 60 kilograms, and a maximum weight of twice that with optional attachments.
During Ciel’s Arc Drive, she drives the stake into her opponent. Afterward, what is ejected from the magazine is not an empty cartridge, but pages of the holy scripture. For vampires, this is no different from being directly injected with the holy scripture itself. There is no doubt that it is a surefire “Immortal Killer.”
