The 27 oldest Dead Apostles.
There are the Ancestors of the Elder Title, whose age exceeds 4000 years, Ancestors sealed by the Holy Church, to a successor every 500 years.
They each have their own factions, and are engaged in vicious power struggles within them. Perhaps for them, this is one of the few things that gives meaning to their existence now that their sense for amusement has completely worn away.
On rare occasions an Ancestor will die, but since there is always a successor to replace them, the number of Ancestors never changes. In fact, it could be said that becoming an Ancestor is the ultimate goal of all Dead Apostles. Even those Dead Apostles at the very bottom, who were changed into vampires by lowly Dead Apostles with no standing or reputation, dream of one day being able to gather enough power to become one of the 27 themselves.
On the other hand, there also exist Ancestors who have no interest in such things at all. They are seekers, who eschew building a kingdom of their very own in favor of chasing after perfect immortality. There are many of these “Ancestors without a faction” among the Dead Apostles that used to be magi.
