The institute Sion belonged to, and one of the three major branches of the Association. Located in the Atlas mountains of Egypt, it is a place where those dedicated to the study of alchemy gather. Colloquially known as the Giant’s Pit.
Unlike the modern alchemy that rose to prominence in the middle ages, the alchemy studied by Atlas could be said to be the progenitor of magecraft. For some reason they are on extraordinarily bad terms with the Prague Association, and even the Clock Tower, the very heart of the Association, keeps their distance.
In order to avoid the “end” proven by their first director, they endlessly create and dispose of weapon after weapon.
There is a saying in the Prague Association: “Lift not the seal of Atlas, lest ye destroy the world seven times over.”
…The reason being that the weapons created there to save the world are ultimately nothing more than tools that will further its destruction.
