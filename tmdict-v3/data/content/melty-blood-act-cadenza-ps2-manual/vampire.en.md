Monsters that suck human blood. Refers mostly to the Dead Apostles, or those that have become bloodsuckers because of them. Though they are basically unaging and immortal, they require human blood to maintain their flesh. Thus, their immortality is imperfect.
Those that have been turned into vampires by Dead Apostles can operate by their own will, but because their behavioral principles are bound by their parent vampire, it is impossible for them to escape their control. In the event that they successfully attack a human and acquire their blood, the majority of it will be taken by the parent vampire.
Consequently, the child vampire will eventually try to become a parent vampire themselves. After spending decades acclimating to life in the darkness, they will start to threaten the world by creating servants of their very own.
In order to put a stop to this vicious cycle of vampirism, the Church created the Burial Agencyâ€”heresy hunters whose aim is the complete extermination of all Dead Apostles.
