Kishima Koumaâ€™s Last Arc.
Triggered by an aerial counter. After it starts, Kouma flies to the edge of the screen, then hits the opponent with a powerful jumping kick. There are two different things that he might yell out at this point, but one of them is extremely rare.
In Buddhism, Yama is the name of the very first human to die, who then became the king of hell. He is also called Enma Dai-O.
