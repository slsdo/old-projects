The Holy Churchâ€™s expert inquisitors.
Not exorcists who cast out devils, but executors who strike them down.
A perfect meritocracy, anybody with the ability to dispose of those truths the Church finds inconvenient can join. The agency is composed of seven members including the director Narbareck, and one reserve member making for a total of eight.
They always work alone, and under no circumstances will they cooperate with the demon hunters of other countries. As they possess absolute authority, there are times when they will defy even the wishes of the Church itself to stamp out heresy.
Arcueid often receives requests from the Church, and has cooperated with them on numerous occasions to exterminate Fallen Ancestors. Nevertheless, if she ever showed even the slightest opening, the Burial Agency would move to seal her without a second thought.
