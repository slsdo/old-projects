The younger of the twin sisters working as servants in the Tohno mansion.
The maid assigned to Shiki, she sports an apathetic expression and an inflexible attitude. Though she seems to be the exact opposite of her older sister Kohaku in that regard, if you look carefully you can see she’s actually demonstrating a wide variety of subtle expressions. Compared to Kohaku, who only ever wears an expression of “happiness,” Hisui actually seems much more human.
Characterized by extreme fastidiousness and a fear of men. Just as Kohaku is naturally unsuited for cleaning up inside, Hisui’s palate is hellishly out of sync with most people’s. It seems the reason she never cooks for Shiki is entirely because she doesn’t want to make him sad.
Normally she’s not a character than can fight, but in *Melty Blood* due to the Tatari’s generous interpretation of a maid as “one who protects their master by any means necessary,” she acquired the legendary Maid-style Killing Arts.
