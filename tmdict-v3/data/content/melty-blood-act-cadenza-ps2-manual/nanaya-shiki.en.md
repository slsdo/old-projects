Shiki the Killer. Eldest son of the Nanaya, a clan of demon hunters that passed down unique abilities as their genetic inheritance.
Though the Nanaya were once feared as the natural enemy of demon hybrids, the last family head, Nanaya Kiri, retired from the demon hunting trade to live a quiet life in the mountains. However, because Tohno Makihisa still regarded them as dangerous, they were raided and completely wiped out.
Except, that is, for Nanaya Shiki. Even though the Nanaya bloodline should have been annihilated without exception. Even though he was the family head’s only son. Somehow, for some reason, he alone survived.
Unlike Tohno Shiki, he uses the Nanaya martial arts, which strains the human body to its utmost limits, without any fear or hesitation.
Also, this is just a digression, but in the game when he comments on the lack of skill after winning a battle, he’s actually talking about himself and not the opponent. After all, an assassination is something that’s over in an instant. For it to turn into a drawn-out “battle” against an enemy, well, what can he do but laugh at his own failure?
