Len’s shadow. She is Len’s unused “active personality” given form using the remnants of Wallachia.
Compared to the normal Len, she is crueler, more vulgar, and ever-so-loveable. She is a contradictory idol, both sensual and chaste.
Her stage, Midsummer Snowfield, could be called Len’s imagined world, and as such, Len is the master of everything in it. Nevertheless, it is completely at the mercy of White Len’s power.
