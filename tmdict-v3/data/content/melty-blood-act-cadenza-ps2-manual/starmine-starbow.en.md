The names of the sorceries used by Aozaki Aoko.
It seems that itâ€™s easy for her to visualize things like exploding fireworks and rotating stars, so her instant incantation spell invariably ends up being nature interference based on these images. The Starmine line is for fluid motion, while the Starbow line is for fluctuating applications.
Aozaki Aoko can be considered a close-combat type magus, who fires magical energy from her elbow that calls forth a spell formula as it passes through her fist. For those unfortunate enough to face her as an enemy, both of her hands probably look like rocket burners.
