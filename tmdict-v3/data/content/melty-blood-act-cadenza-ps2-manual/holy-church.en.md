The hidden side of the prominent religion whose name means “universal.” In *Tsukihime*, it is referred to merely as “The Church.”
Those who teach the word of God do not acknowledge things which run counter to their doctrine. Though the public face of the Church simply treats these heresies as if they do not exist at all, there were zealots within the organization who felt they should be dealt with more proactively. This enormous division that specializes in the hunting of heresy is known as the Holy Church.
They lead the devil exterminators called Executors, and exist for just two reasons: to completely expunge all heresy, and to properly manage those mysteries that are beyond human control.
Naturally, they are on bad terms with the Association, which seeks to conceal magecraft, and the two have crossed swords time and time again. However, their real enemies are the monsters known as “bloodsuckers.” For the sake of combatting this greater threat, they have even been known to cooperate with the Association on occasion.
Also, there are various jurisdictions within the Church as well. The Burial Agency, which Ciel belongs to, are like the elite commandos of heresy hunting.
