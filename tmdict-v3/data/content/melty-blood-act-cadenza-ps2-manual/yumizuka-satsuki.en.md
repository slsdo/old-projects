Shiki’s classmate. During the vampire incident one year ago, she was bitten by the vampire Roa and subsequently went missing.
In *Re-act*, she appears as a dropout vampire who still sides with humanity despite having been turned into a Dead Apostle.
She is a pitiable girl, who had been Shiki’s classmate several times since middle school, but never managed to capture his attention. Even now, she is nursing an unrequited one-sided love.
Something of an oddity, she was unremarkable as a human, yet had exceptional talent as a vampire. The fact that she was able to operate as a Dead Apostle less than a day after being bitten is totally unheard of.
