A general term for the act of artificially reenacting mysteries and miracles.
Although each school has its individual differences, it is basically a mechanism for using the magical energy in the practitioner’s body or the outside world, in order to reenact a predetermined phenomenon. The practitioner sends an order (command) to the foundation (system) controlled by their school, and a pre-made function (program) is executed. The “electrical current” needed to send that command and execute the program is magical energy.
Though magecraft may seem almighty, it is basically the bringing about of mysteries by means of equivalent exchange. Accordingly, magecrafts powerful enough to interfere with Nature will obviously require enough magical energy (mana) to fill Nature just to execute them. There is a limit to the sorceries that can be executed using an individual’s magical energy alone.
