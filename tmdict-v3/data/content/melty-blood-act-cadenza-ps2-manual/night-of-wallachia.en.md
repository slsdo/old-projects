A member of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors. One who tried to embody eternity not as a living being, but as a phenomenon. Tatari.
A Dead Apostle with the unique ability to converge upon rumors in a region and materialize them for a single night. Because it takes the form of what the people fear the most, they can neither defeat it nor escape it. The “Night of Wallachia” specifically refers to the reality marble that shuts away a town in that horror movie-like world.
When he was still a normal Dead Apostle, his name was Zepia Eltnam Oberon. Even after inheriting the position of number thirteen among the Dead Apostle Ancestors, he yearned for still more power, and became the phenomenon “Tatari.”
Of course, that was nothing more than a means to an end—his true objective lay elsewhere. Unfortunately, though, he was unable to accomplish it, and he drifted through the world as the Tatari to the bitter end.
