The eyes possessed by Tohno Shiki, that can see the death of things.
A unique ability that allows the user to grasp the death of living beings as points and lines. Stabbing or cutting these will ignore things like vital activity and kill the target directly.
Though they are said to see the form of death, strictly speaking it’s more accurate to say they’re reading the lifespan of a substance—the existential limit determined at the moment of creation.
Lines cannot be perceived on things that can’t be killed (destroyed) in the current world. It’s probably because as a human, Shiki’s point of reference conforms to the limits of the humanity of his era.
Originally, Shiki’s eyes were meant to “see that which cannot be seen.” However, after having two near death experiences his brain began to be able to comprehend death itself. Or to put it in other words, it is only by virtue of his mystic eyes and brain working together as a set that he is able to perceive death.
