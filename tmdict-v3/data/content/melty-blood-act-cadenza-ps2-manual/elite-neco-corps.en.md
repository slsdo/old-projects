The Neco Arcs summoned by Neco Arc. The GCV’s only military unit.
It is a self-defense force composed solely of specially chosen Neco Arcs whose overflowing savage nature, excellent physical ability, and unmatched intelligence cannot be controlled. These chosen few are known as Abaddon’s Beret, and are the envy of all the Neco Arcs.
