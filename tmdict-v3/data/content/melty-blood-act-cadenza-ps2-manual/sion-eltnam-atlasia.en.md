An Atlas alchemist who came to Misaki in order to put an end to the Tatari.
Her weapons are Etherlite (a nano-scale filament) and the Barrel Replica (an imitation of the “Black Barrel”).
Even within Atlas, she is one of the most promising up and coming alchemists, and the name Atlasia marks her as the Institute’s next director.
She participated in the battle against the Tatari three years ago, but was defeated. Though she was the sole survivor, afterward she began pursuing the Tatari on her own without returning to either Atlas or the Church.
She has an overly serious and inflexible personality, but deep down she’s a warmhearted genius scholar. Among the constantly feuding *Tsukihime* heroines, she’s a rare type capable of getting along with everybody.
