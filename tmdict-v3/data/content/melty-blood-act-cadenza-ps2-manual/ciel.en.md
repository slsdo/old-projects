An upperclassman at Shiki’s school. Due to her gentle, polite speech, the way she always lends a helping hand to those in need, and her ability to comfort those in grief, everybody at school considers her a person of integrity even more reliable than the teachers.
In reality, she is an executor sent by the Church to stamp out heresy, and a member of the organization known as the Burial Agency.
She possesses combat ability specialized for fighting vampires, and her own potential also exceeds the realm of humans.
However, she is not a mere brute—her skills as an intelligence agent are quite high as well. For instance, she can implant suggestions using magecraft. It’s because of this that nobody around her gave the name Ciel (which by all rights should have raised some eyebrows) a second thought.
Though she came to Misaki hunting a certain Dead Apostle, once there she encountered an even bigger prize: Arcueid Brunestud. As Arcueid’s ally, Shiki should have been her enemy, but they nevertheless became friends.
Also, she’s such a huge curry lover that she’d be happy eating nothing but curry rice with curry udon for lunch every single day. Ever since coming to Misaki, the Indian Curry House Messiaen has become something of an oasis for her.
