The Charging China Girl.
A young girl that (secretly) idolizes Shiki as her big brother. Currently a sixth-grader in elementary school.
After his traffic accident, Tohno Shiki was adopted into the Arima household, and it seems that for Miyako it was love at first sight. However, she had no idea how to deal with suddenly having an older brother out of nowhere, and ended up repeating the same cycle of awkward communication over and over. In the years leading up to his return to the Tohno mansion, she didn’t manage to have a proper conversation with him even once.
“This house has a dojo, but nobody ever uses it. What a waste!”
Thinking that, Miyako started practicing (self-taught) kempo every day. Though it’s merely pretend baji quan at the level of a child’s play, in *Melty Blood* it became the real thing for a single night due to the Tatari’s influence. Of course, this delighted her to no end.
Also, she is recognized by Neco Arc as a much-awaited future rival.
