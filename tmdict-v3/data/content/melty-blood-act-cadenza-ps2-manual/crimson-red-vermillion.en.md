The name for when those with inhuman heritage have drawn out their sleeping blood to the maximum possible extent.
The name Crimson Red Vermillion is unique to the families ruled over by the Tohno household. Elsewhere, it is known as Ancestral Return.
As one with particularly tainted blood, the possibility that Akiha will become a Crimson Red Vermillion is high.
You can catch a glimpse of this during Tohno Akiha and Kishima Koumaâ€™s Arc Drives. Also, though Kouma is the closest to attaining it at the current stage, Akiha is actually the one with more aptitude for it.
