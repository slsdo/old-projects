The nanofilament wire wielded by Sion.
Although it’s used like a whip in the game, it’s actually designed to attach to the opponent’s skin, integrate with their central nervous system, and read their thoughts and memories. It is because of this technique that the name Eltnam has become synonymous with spiritual hacking.
Though the thought-reading function seems vile enough, its ability to “merge with and copy memories and experiences” is actually even more dangerous. This inhumane and demonic “acquisition of another’s life,” which even the Atlas Institute shuns, is a technique unique to the Eltnam family.
