Kishima Kouma’s Arc Drive.
Though it bears a striking resemblance to Tohno Akiha’s Arc Drive, the nuance is completely different. In Akiha’s case, the opponent is merely mistaking the feeling of having their heat stolen as a burning sensation, while in Kouma’s case both they and the surrounding environment are actually being consumed by hellfire.
The name Jambudvīpa comes from Buddhism. It is the southernmost of the four island-continents surrounding Mount Sumeru in the Desire realm Kāmadhātu, and the place where humans live. Basically, another name for Sahā-lokadhātu, the endurance world.
