Yumizuka Satsuki’s Last Arc. A reality marble.
Satsuki’s powers blossomed after becoming a vampire, and this is her strongest attack. As the name “depletion” suggests, the magical energy in the deployed space is rapidly dissipated. Though it is similar to Akiha’s Origami, the target of Depletion Garden is the world itself. Also, the depleted magical energy does not return to the user, Satsuki, but instead merely vanishes.
It is a field effect that could be considered the natural enemy of magi, who require magical energy to attack, and elementals, who require magical energy just to exist.
On the other hand, against organisms that are cut off from the world (for instance, humans, who don’t use the magical energy in the atmosphere much at all) there will not be a pronounced effect.
