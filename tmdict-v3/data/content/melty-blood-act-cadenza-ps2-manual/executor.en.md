Inquisitors of the Holy Church. Those who eliminate heresies that do not exist in the Church’s doctrine.
If exorcists are those who drive out devils from the possessed, then executors are those who exterminate devils on the spot. “Not to banish, but defeat. Not to rescue, but erase.” That is the ideology that drives the executors.
However, according to the Church, humans do not have the authority to defeat demons, because even demons are the creations of God. The name “executor” comes from the fact that the executors transcend that teaching, and act as God’s proxy on earth to stamp out heresy.
