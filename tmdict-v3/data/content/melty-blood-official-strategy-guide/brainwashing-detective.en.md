Hisui’s special attack. The idea came from the website “Brain Wash Detective - Hisui” which hosted a silly picture drawn by Takeshi Takeuchi. In the very first release of *Tsukihime*, there was a laughably large number of errors, especially in Hisui’s lines, like “I’ll take your room to you.” Takeuchi used one of those mistakes as the basis for this joke. “Kinoko Nasu, the mad craftsman of prose, delivers a new mystery title!” was the line used in the joke, and who would’ve thought that we’d see it again in the form of a special attack. By the way, her catch phrase is “You are the criminal.” To digress, she seems to have decided on Ciel as the criminal.
