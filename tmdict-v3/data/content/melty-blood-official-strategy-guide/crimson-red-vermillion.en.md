This is the name of “borderline demon beings” which were born of the Tohno family line with its age-old demon bloodline. Also known as “Ancestral-Return.” Once a member of the family is overwhelmed by their demon blood, they can never return to being human again. In *Tsukihime* and *Kagetsu Tohya*, the Kishima branch family (of the Tohya family), have inherited especially thick demon blood. The label Crimson Red Vermillion is used for those of mixed-blood descent who drew out their non-human blood to the max.
