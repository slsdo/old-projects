A rare drug made from wormwood, brandy, scallop, shrimp, and some 5-year-old leftover chemical substances. It can make Akiha grow up to 10 times her regular size, and become G-Akiha. The name of this drug is suspected to be based on the previous head of the Tohno household, Tohno Makihisa. The X must mean *Big X*{{n1}}, maybeâ€¦?
