To put it simply, Dead Apostles are your average/normal vampires in the *Tsukihime* lore. You can find out all the juicy details about them by reading through *Tsukihime*. The first 27 Dead Apostles which were created by the True Ancestors are called “The Twenty-seven Dead Apostle Ancestors” and are the strongest of the Dead Apostles. However, a number of them have already been taken down by the Church. The 10th Dead Apostle Ancestor is Nrvnqsr Chaos, and Roa who is ranked outside of the list due to his uniqueness, were both taken out by Shiki and company in *Tsukihime*. In *Melty Blood* the concept of Dead Apostles doesn’t really exist.
