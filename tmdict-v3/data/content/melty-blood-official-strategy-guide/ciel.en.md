Her real name is Elisia. She is Shiki’s upperclassman, and known as Ciel to him. She awakened as a Dead Apostle in the past, and was once struck down by Arcueid, but for some reason her body can’t die. In *Melty Blood* that situation has already come to pass and is no longer an issue, so she is simply an amazing person in the game (even the great detective Hayakawa Ken is surprised by her…). She is the seventh ranking operative of the Burial Agency, and uses so many projectile weapons that her nickname is “Bow.” It was Ciel herself who customized The Horn of the Beast into its current form, The Seventh Holy Scripture.
