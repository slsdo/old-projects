A mysterious lifeform that flies on top people’s head when they are close to passing out. Once she’s on you try not to take damage or do any crazy moves… how unfortunate. Originally from the *Tsukihime* help corner “Teach Me! Ciel-sensei” in which she played the straight man through and through. In *Kagetsu Tohya* she also appeared in an Arcueid event graphic, and her fame has continued to rise. Now she is basically TYPE-MOON’s mascot character.
