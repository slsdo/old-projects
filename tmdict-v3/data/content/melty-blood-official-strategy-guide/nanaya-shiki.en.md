Shiki’s former name, but in *Tsukihime* it is often used to refer to the manifestation of Shiki’s murderous alternate personality. Especially in *Kagetsu Tohya*, in which we can see Nanaya surfacing of his own will and taking over Shiki’s body… although this is somewhat the fault of Shiki himself. As far as Shiki is concerned, Nanaya is none other than the harbinger of Shiki’s destruction.
