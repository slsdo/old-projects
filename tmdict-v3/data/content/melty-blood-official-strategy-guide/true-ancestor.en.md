A type of vampire, but really they are closer to being spirits. Of the available characters Arcueid is a True Ancestor. True Ancestors serve as a defense mechanism for nature, since nature possesses no natural defense mechanism capable of stopping the human race. The True Ancestors have a fatal flaw in that they succumb to vampiric blood sucking impulses, and True Ancestors who fail to resist the urge to suck blood are labeled as Fallen True Ancestors, and hunted by Arcueid. Also, a human who has their blood sucked by a True Ancestor becomes a Dead Apostle.
