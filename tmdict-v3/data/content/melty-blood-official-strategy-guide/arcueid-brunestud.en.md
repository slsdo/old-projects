A princess of the True Ancestors born solely to hunt fallen True Ancestors and the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors. Usually she slumbers in Millenium Castle Brunestud which she materialized herself, but when a Dead Apostle shows its face, she awakens accordingly. When she finishes her hunt, she returns to her slumber, so since being born, she has spent less than a year’s worth of time actually awake and active in the world (although since meeting Shiki she has been awake continuously for a year). In the visual novel *Tsukihime*, Arcueid meets Shiki, and awakens Shiki’s demon hunter blood. Arcueid is a True Ancestor, and thus should basically never be defeated and killed, but Shiki’s Mystic Eyes of Death Perception proved to be too much, and she died after being cut into 17 pieces. Despite not appearing at all in some of the routes in *Tsukihime*, Arcueid is undoubtedly considered to be the main heroine of the story, and she has never once given up her position at the top of TYPE-MOON character popularity polls. Like the proper heroine that she is, her catch phrase is “You killed me. I’ll have you take full responsibility now.”
