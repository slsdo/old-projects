The supreme headquarters of the Mage’s Association. Clock Tower refers to The British Museum. Shiki’s “teacher” was a pupil of the Clock Tower. The mechanisms of magic and magecraft are only briefly touched upon in *Tsukihime*, so if you want to know more please check out the novel *Kara no Kyoukai* (Garden of Sinners - doujinshi/self-published version) in which the main scenario writer Kinoko Nasu explains in more detail.
