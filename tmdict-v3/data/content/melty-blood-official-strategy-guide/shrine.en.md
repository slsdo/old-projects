A half-built sky rise in Misaki City. Its name literally means “ancient temple.” Some people say it will be a department store, others say a company’s headquarters. It seems like the residents of Misaki City don’t really know. It is the location that Night of Wallachia materializes, and the place where Shiki and Sion first met.
