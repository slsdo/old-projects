The daughter of the Tohno branch family that Shiki lived with until moving to the main Tohno household. Miyako was cast as Shiki’s younger sister, but it seems that the two didn’t communicate much despite living together, perhaps because of the role she was given. Her mother is Arima Keiko, and father Arima Fumiomi. To digress, you can see the rough version of Miyako’s victory pose in the *Tsukihime Dokuhon* (a.k.a. The Blue Book). By the way, the first proper art with her was released on a plastic fan distributed as a freebie at the Summer Comiket that *Kagetsu Tohya* was released at. That art can also be found in the *Tsuki Bako* set on the *PLUS+DISC* in the wallpaper section.
