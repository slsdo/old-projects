Anti-Makikyu X. A drug used to return G-Akiha to her original size. The name comes from the oldest son of the Kugamine family, Tonami. Kugamine is a branch family of the Tohno family, and Tonami is Akiha’s former fiancé. In a sense, he has quite the record. Also to note is that Kugamine Tonami only appears in *Kagetsu Tohya* (not in *Tsukihime*).
