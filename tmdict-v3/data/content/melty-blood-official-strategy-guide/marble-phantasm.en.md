A special attack performed using Arcueid’s special gauge (magic circuit). Also called Marble Phantasm. In *Tsukihime*, Arcueid’s marble phantasm is depicted as an ability that allows her to materialize her thoughts. In *Melty Blood*, TATARI (Night of Wallachia), who transforms into Red Arcueid uses Marble Phantasm to materialize Millenium Castle Brunstud. Originally, Marble Phantasm was a power held by elementals, or “the touch of the Earth,” but it turned out that there are some within the Dead Apostles who can also use it.
