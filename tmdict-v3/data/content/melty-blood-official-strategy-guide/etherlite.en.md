A nanofilament made by spinning ether (the fifth imaginary element). For generations the Eltnam family has employed this filament to hack people’s brains, and make the knowledge of the hacked target their own. This modus operando has earned them the name “spirit hackers.” After connecting to a target just once, the filament can be extended up to 5,000 meters. Sion uses etherlite to incapacitate, attack, and steal knowledge among other things.
