Excellent Atlas alchemists could freely use parallel processing to “compute” their thoughts and ideas, enabling them to instantly think things which would normally take a longer mental processing time. Looking at Sion in *Melty Blood*, we can see that she has processing power which is at least 7 times that of a normal human (meaning at least 7 “processors”). Sion’s processing power ranks among that of the top alchemists.
