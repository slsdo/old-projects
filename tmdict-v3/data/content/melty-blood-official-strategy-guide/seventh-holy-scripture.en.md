Ciel’s conceptual weapon. The iron hammer of reincarnation judgement. More than 1,000 years have passed since it was first created, and a spirit resides within (the figure you see when Ciel appears is the spirit). The spirit is called Seven, and she takes care of a wide range of things for Ciel, from sewing to being the target of Ciel’s stress relief. The spirit is also called Nanako (refer to *Kagetsu Tohya* for details).
