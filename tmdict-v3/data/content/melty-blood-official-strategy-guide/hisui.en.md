A servant of the Tohno family, and Kohaku’s twin sister. She is in charge of caring for Shiki. Shiki isn’t a morning person, so she probably has it pretty tough trying to get him up. She seems quiet and emotionless at first, but if you pay attention she actually displays a greater variety of emotion than Kohaku. She is the complete opposite of Kohaku, so that means she is great at cleaning and tidying, but her sense of taste (food-wise) is terrible, so don’t make her spend too much time or effort on kitchen work. Even when she puts her all into making something, the best she could come up with was a plum sandwich (!), but Shiki still ate it seeing as he is that kind of guy. You can find this scene in *Kagetsu Tohya*.
