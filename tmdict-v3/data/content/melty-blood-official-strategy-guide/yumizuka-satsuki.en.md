Nickname: Sacchin. In *Tsukihime*, she is set as an unlucky girl. Despite having had a crush on Shiki since junior high, she did not talk with him properly until shortly before becoming a Dead Apostle. At the start of *Melty Blood*, when Sion talks about a girl who became a vampire before her eyes, she is talking about Satsuki. She has a low chance of appearing before the fight with Miyako, and that’s her only appearance…. Although there seems to be something related to her she moving behind the scenes… the keyword is “next patch!?”
