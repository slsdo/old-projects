His name originates from Wallachia, in Romania, which is where TATARI first came into being. His backstory is that rumors of Vlad the Impaler, whose life story became the basis for Dracula, became TATARI. Zepia challenged The Sixth (Program No. 6/ The Sixth Law), which led to his defeat, and in turn allowed him to successfully imprint himself as a phenomena of the world. Night of Wallachia has completely calculated all possible outcomes of the world, and now he is an enigmatic Dead Apostle who “occurs” at pre-calculated areas in the real world through the materialization of rumors. For more details, see Sion’s dialogue in the *Melty Blood* K Route “Summer Illusion, King of Fallacy.” Also “Program No. 6” mentioned at the start of the story mode refers to The Sixth which Night of Wallachia challenged.
