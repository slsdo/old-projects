The main protagonist of *Tsukihime*. Formerly Nanaya Shiki. Originally born into a demon hunter family, but when his family was destroyed, he was taken in by the Tohno family. After a certain accident, Shiki was sent to live at the Arima household. The story of *Tsukihime* starts with Shiki being called back to live at the Tohno residence. In *Melty Blood*, there is a storyline where Miyako comes to take back her big bro. Despite being stereotypical… it doesn’t feel wrong….
