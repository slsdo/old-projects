Kohaku described Mecha Hisui as “Developed in secrecy by the Tohno Weapons Division without Akiha’s knowledge, and designed to excel in city infiltration and suppression of the local population. Mecha Hisui is a weapon of pure joy.” Mecha Hisui has a variety of abilities, such as her “Guide and Interfere” function; when used she drags Akiha into a sticky situation and then blows herself up. Mecha Hisui also has the ability “Redoubled Effort” which lets her wrap elastic bands around a target. She is sure to play a major role in controlling Misaki City! But wait, there’s more! If you buy one today, you will also get the mass production model for free! Maybe… it all depends on Shiki’s fight outcomes, and Kohaku’s mood.
