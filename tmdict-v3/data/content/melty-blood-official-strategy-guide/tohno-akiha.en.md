Shiki’s younger sister. She lives in the Tohno household that has taken in Shiki. She reigns (?) as the head of the family. A confident girl with a firm personality and emphasis on discipline. So no matter how much she wants to fawn over Shiki, she can’t bring herself to do so. The development team often teased that her concept was “flat chest,” but one can’t help but think that saying something like that about a girl is going overboard. In *Tsukihime*, she retains her strict personality even as she is swallowed by her inversion impulse and meets a series of unfortunate (or perhaps fortunate) events as she teeters on the edge of becoming full Crimson Red Vermillion. In *Melty Blood* and *Kagetsu Tohya*, which essentially take place in parallel worlds, she appears quite dashing with her long crimson red hair fluttering in the breeze. Well I guess it’s just another dream…?
