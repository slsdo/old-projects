The craziest strategist serving the Tohno family. From time-to-time you can see her transform into Magical Amber, or maybe not. She always seems to be smiling and laughingâ€¦ She has great cooking skills, but avoids cleaning like the plague. She is the complete opposite of her younger sister Hisui. She is also the one mainly responsible for taking care of Akiha.
