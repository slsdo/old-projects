Another name for the female knight who is a Shield Knight. It’s said that in order to save Sion, she was supposedly killed by TATARI 3 years prior to the events of *Melty Blood*. In the *Tsuki-Bako* *PLUS+DISC* “Getcha2” corner, we learned that originally she was going to be the main heroine in *Melty Blood*, and Ciel’s rival. It seems that her weapon is a pile bunker{{n1}}. It would be nice to see a showdown between Riesbyfe’s pile bunker, and Ciel’s Seventh Holy Scripture.
