Does the G stand for Giant? Great? Or how about Gargantuan? In any case, she is BIG. You can’t say she doesn’t have a chest anymore. Despite having no facial expressions as tells for her attacks, you can read her arm movements easy enough, but sometimes she shoots lasers from her eyes… which may remind you of the last boss of a certain game from Watanabe’s game outfit.
