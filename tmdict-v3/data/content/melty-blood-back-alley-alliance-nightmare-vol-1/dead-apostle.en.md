Refers to those that became vampires after having their blood sucked by either a True Ancestor or another Dead Apostle. Makes up a large portion of the beings referred to as vampires. Their bodies are nearly immortal; however, they can’t deal with being exposed to the sun. …Although related [by name and in concept], the zenith of the Dead Apostle hierarchy known as the Twenty-seven Dead Apostle Ancestors does not exist in any world in which heroic spirits can be summoned.
