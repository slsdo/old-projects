Organization for the Preservation of Human Order. Chaldea is a special organization founded with the goal of preventing the [ostensibly] inevitable extinction of mankind. Chaldea monitors that which cannot be perceived by magecraft, nor measured by science. Researchers both magi and scientist alike were impartially gathered to be a part of the organization. In 2015, the near future [time] range observed by the Near-Future Observation Lens SHEBA (developed by Lev) was found to have vanished, and a space-time singularity was discovered. Chaldea is faced with either finding a breakthrough resolution, or destroying the singularity.
