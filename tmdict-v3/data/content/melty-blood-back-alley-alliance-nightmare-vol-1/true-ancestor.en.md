Vampires from birth. For lack of a direct recourse to guard against mankind, the planet created the True Ancestors as its defense. True Ancestors essentially serve as natureâ€™s sense of touch. An unique existence even among blood-sucking species. Can also be thought of as spirits with a physical body.
