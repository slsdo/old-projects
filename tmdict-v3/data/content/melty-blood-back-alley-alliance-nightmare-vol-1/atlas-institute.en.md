An organization of magi and alchemists based somewhere in Egypt’s Atlas Mountains. One of the three great branches of the Mage’s Association. The Atlas Institute holds that the future demise of mankind is inevitable, and works so as to delay mankind’s expiration in every possible way. Even the metamorphosis or retrogression of humans as a species is accordingly deemed acceptable – as long as such measures enable an extension of humanity’s survival. Unlike other magi, members of the Atlas Institute do not pursue the evolution of humans into lifeforms of a higher order.
