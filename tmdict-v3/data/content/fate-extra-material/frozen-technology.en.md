This refers to how technology development has stagnated since 1970 due to restrictions and regulations enforced by the West Europe Plutocracy.
Aerospace industry development is especially restricted. Despite there being a slow trickle of advancement and new technology, no genius talent has appeared with a breakthrough.
Furthermore, due to the slowing development of weapons and an extreme decrease in the availability of resources, by the year 2000 it was close to its peak.
Another significant difference [in the alternate world of EXTRA] is that warfare is primarily conducted through cyber attacks, at very large scales.
The face of modern war is characterized by attackers using the network to destroy the management capabilities of cities and then they proceed to carry out primitive terrorist-style attacks. Ironically, cyber attacks don’t cost much and do no harm to the environment. It’s not too much to say that cyber warfare is environmentally friendly.
