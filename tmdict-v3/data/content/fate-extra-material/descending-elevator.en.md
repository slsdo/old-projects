In the Holy Grail War, after the six day moratorium{{n1}}, this elevator takes all the Masters to the Decisive Battleground on the seventh day. The appearance of the elevator is similar to that of a church’s confessional.
Within the sealed domain behind the firewall, the Masters exchange words for the last time.
It’s the final chance to reconfirm each other’s past, future, thoughts, and connections.
Enemies and friends who shouldn’t be able to come to an understanding.
But perhaps there is a way to come to understand each other, this kind of relationship.
Just a few minutes later the battles begin, and Moon Cell is watching, recording the fluctuations of each combatant’s heart and mind.
