One of the two big religions in the world.
Although the Holy Church somewhat lost its religious foundation due to the effects of the Great Collapse (the pole shift), it developed a new policy and adjusted its trajectory, and within the world of EXTRA maintains considerable power and influence.
On one hand there is the Holy Church, that praises the miracles that come from their holy one.
On the other hand there is the Mage’s Association, that aims to uncover all the mysteries related to man.
The battle between these two great forces form the backbone of Fate/stay night, however within the world of EXTRA the victor has already been determined as the Holy Church.
Well, even with that being said the Holy Church has changed since the time of its founding, and Cardinal Laurentis, who usually specializes in trickery and working behind the scenes, has begrudgingly accepted to become the Pope.
Purportedly the reason that he doesn’t want to become the Pope is because, “I’m such an atrocious fellow that it’s ridiculous to think that I could be the successor of the Pope.”
