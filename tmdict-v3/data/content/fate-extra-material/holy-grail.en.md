In previous works the term Holy Grail referred to a wish granting machine that could grant any wish, but in EXTRA this term refers to the right to use Moon Cell.
If you browse through the massive amount of records and simulated data that Moon Cell holds, you will certainly be able to find a version of Earth with the future that you desire.
The you who has obtained the right to use Moon Cell need only say the following to Moon Cell:
“Recreate my ideal future.”
Moon Cell will quickly set about to bring the state of Earth to match the shape of the future you desire. The Moon has all the necessary knowledge and physical means to change the world.
For example, if you were to wish “Make all the girls on Earth my little sisters.” In about ten years or so societies on Earth would have changed to be so.
Or alternatively, all of Earth would be managed and directed to work in order to make a device to allow one to experience that dream realistically.
There’s nothing that the human race can’t realize as long as it’s within the scope of human imagination. No matter what kind of fantasy, no matter how unrealistic, there is a way to realize and experience it.
