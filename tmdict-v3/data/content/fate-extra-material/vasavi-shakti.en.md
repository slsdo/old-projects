O Sun, Abide to Death.
Launcher Karnaâ€™s anti-army Noble Phantasm.
It is a spear made of lightning that will completely destroy anything in a single hit.
It can be thought of as the Hindu version of the Buster Launcher.
In the game he goes around busting stuff up with this. Karna has no idea himself, but between his appearance, and the wings that are scattered around when he uses this attack, he makes for quite the Visual Kei style Servant.
