She is the High Level AI in the infirmary.
Her job is to care for the health of the Masters. Like Kotomine, she exists in order for the Holy Grail War to be carried out smoothly and efficiently.
The family name of this AI is selected at random from among the family names of the Holy Grail War participants. This time the AI received the name “Matou” from Matou Shinji.
Despite the structure of her body being extremely similar to that of a human, and having a human personality, Sakura can seem a bit mechanical due to her devotion to her work.
Sakura is a deeply thoughtful person, but keeps her thoughts to herself. She is always being considerate of those around her.
In Fate/stay night she is by far and wide the unluckiest character.
In EXTRA she just fulfilled the simple role of dispensing medicine, but in CCC she is catapulted to main character status out of nowhere… but she still seems to be somewhat overwhelmed by the rest of the cast.
Supposedly she is an “mild, brave, and adorable” triple-threat of a heroine (*According to Moon Cell’s research), but she seems kind of dry in EXTRA, and keeps her distance from the Masters.
Her solitary existence has led her to grow up not knowing love, and even now she is a girl who has no dreams.
In the early portions of CCC her role is purely functional.
As the events proceed she slowly develops some more human-like behaviour.
Resonates with Rani due to their shared status as “created things,” and privately they are actually quite friendly.
She has trouble dealing with Rin, but that’s because Sakura holds Rin to be the ideal woman. Their relationship probably doesn’t go smoothly because Sakura wants to become like her, so Sakura gets nervous whenever they meet…
But even with that being said, the fact sometimes Sakura can treat Rin rather meanly can be a pretty cute and entertaining sight. Sakura-type characters possess a structural ailment that gives them an aggressive disposition that even Moon Cell can’t remove.
