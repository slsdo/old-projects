Perpetual Engine - Maiden Empire.
This is Caster’s anti-world Noble Phantasm. It resets the battle to turn 1.
If you don’t defeat Caster before the turn she has declared, you’ll end up playing with the two maidens forever.
The servant Nursery Rhyme takes on the form that her Master desires. This Noble Phantasm works in similar fashion, and can be said that this to be the ultimate materialization of Alice’s dreams.

“The story goes on for all eternity.
As though putting my slender finger back on the first line of the first page,
Or perhaps pulling out the second volume.
As long as the hand that follows the text, continues to reject reality.”
