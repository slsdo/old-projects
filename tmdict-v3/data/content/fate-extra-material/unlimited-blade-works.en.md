How many times have I’ve gone over this, Nausicaa?
This is Archer’s Noble Phantasm. It’s a barren wasteland with a thousand swords scattered about.
A great ritual deployed using eight lines of projection.
It’s a kind of old world magecraft known as a Reality Marble. A Reality Marble materializes the user’s inner world and overwrites the real world with it for a short period of time.
All the weapons that Archer can project are present in this space, and there is no need for him to project anything from scratch. He can immediately use any weapon that’s sticking in the ground.
In EXTRA, since the requirements for producing wrought iron have increased, Holy Sword class projections are possible (although their power is inferior to the originals).
…Well, what really happened is I took my eyes off the 3D art team for a second, and when I looked again I was surprised to find they had made an animation of “Excalibur Projection.” Since they put the effort in to make it, I figured might as well include it. As long as the Holy Swords are inferior to the originals I deemed them to be borderline safe as far as the lore goes.
