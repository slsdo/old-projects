Matou Shinji.
He is a game champion from the Asia area, and he treats his participation as a Master in the Holy Grail War as though it were just part of a game.
He is an extremely selfish individual and considers himself to be one of the privileged few. He is a troubled boy who always considers those around them to be below him.
He sticks out for his rather immature behavior toward others, although it’s not unexpected seeing as he is a child who just reached the age of eight.
He tries to put up a strong front by projecting an avatar made to look like him when he will be 16, “I’m not a kid anymore!”
Shinji is actually a first-class magus. In order to “make” an excellent son, Shinji’s Mother purchased the semen of an excellent man and used it to bear Shinji. This was done despite the fact that she still has a living husband.
The protagonist fights Shinji in the first round.
It is a battle between the protagonist who has no reason to fight, and the genius gamer who thinks of the battle as another game to play.
Like many other Masters who thought similarly, Shinji only realized that the Holy Grail War was genuinely a death game upon his own defeat.

Shinji is also a Master that makes an appearance in CCC.
In CCC he is as usual; completely self-serving to the end, and altogether incompatible with the protagonist. Although he may seem like a pretty twisted individual, just a lonely eight year old kid.
“I’m lonely, I want to make friends.” Unable to ignore his true feelings, he makes up some reason to show up in the student council room.
His separation from Rider weighs on his mind, and he anxiously wants to return to the near side of the Moon as soon as possible.
While the protagonist has pretty bad luck with women, Shinji does too… well at least he has pretty terrible luck with Servants.
Shinji knows “the protagonist cried” because right before his death he was imprisoned by BB in an imaginary number space where he could search the vast universe of records, and learned about the ordeal upon searching for “things related to Matou Shinji.” …in that universe the last thing that was recorded related to Shinji’s life was a vision of a friend he didn’t care about who was crying as he reminisced about Shinji.
