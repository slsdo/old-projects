This refers to the passage beautifully read aloud at the beginning of each chapter.
It hints at the main boss of the chapter, but actually if you examine all of the passages together you will notice that they are about a certain character. However, BB’s talk from “interludes” and the passages in chapter 7 of the main route are about BB.
