Jinako is a Master that appears in CCC.
Her Servant is the Launcher Karna.
A shut-in, and a game champion in Western Europe, however rather than winning through pure skill she made her name by emphasizing play time, speedruns, highscores and other unique play-throughs of games. Her handle name is Jinako [じな子].
Her nationality is German. Her father is German, and her mother is Japanese.
An only child from a fairly strict household in which she was treated and raised fairly well. When she was a junior high student she lost both parents in an accident, and inherited a fairly large amount of money which was enough to live decently for the rest of her life.
She did not attend high school (Although she did not consciously decide to not go to high school, there was simply no one who told her to go, so she stayed home).
An avid otaku by nature, little-by-little she bought up otaku goods from around the world, and enjoyed a fairly comfortable hikkikomori [shut-in] otaku lifestyle.
Often appearing on the mega popular European internet BBS called Piece Journal (abbreviated as PJ) which served as her means of communication with other otaku. In short she is a net-hikky [internet hikkikomori / net recluse].
On PJ she was fawned over with the likes of “big inheritance + hikkikomori = you win at life” and for awhile Jinako thought that her lifestyle wasn’t half bad at all…
But as news began to roll in of her otaku friends and old classmates from junior high getting jobs or getting married, Jinako started to feel a little uncertain about her lifestyle.

“No no no, being a NEET is being a true winner at life y’know.”

…But at the same time she somewhat felt like she was left behind by something important.
Living through the strong-fronted personality she built on the net, and pretending to have no troubles came to only provide temporary relief from her worries.
So when she would turn around into her room, away from her computer and the net, she found herself covered in a transparent unease.
Of course, with Jinako having enough money to live out her life, she was not worried about her financial situation. She was looking beyond that, pondering if she should really continue living like this forever. Thinking about her future clouded her thoughts , so she would hide under her sheets and escape into sleep.
The worries and unease that enveloped Jinako were made of her feelings of wanting to give up, and, as expected, her reflection on the life she had lived so far.

Jinako, a former net addict, casually decided to participate in the Holy Grail War.
The reason she decided to participate is “to redo my life” and if possible she wants to create a future where her mother and father didn’t die and she goes to high school and lives out a normal high school otaku life.
Normal friends, and a normal boyfriend (…if she can get one), and a normal girl’s life is what she desires.
This is her true wish.
But after joining the Holy Grail War, she found herself surrounded by talented geniuses in a game with no place to run.
The chicken Jinako tries to boycott the war before the battles begin, and ends up holing herself up in an empty storage closet she finds by chance in the school.
“If I just hide here until the winner is decided there’ll be no problem. Jinako, you are such a genius!”
Despite putting on a strong face like this just for herself, as the Holy Grail War progressed she realizes that once the seventh round has ended she too will be erased.
She realized because she could hear the announcements that sounded throughout the school building.
About when the fifth round was happening Jinako, still unable to face the reality that once the seventh round finishes the school will completely disappear, fell mentally ill and became completely overcome with self-centered emotion. Due to the fear of imminent death she becomes addicted to her temporary home in the storage closet and just before going insane, or possibly at the very moment she went insane, she fell to the far side of the Moon and lost all her memories.
She may have escaped her fate of death in CCC, but after finding the smallest of hopes, her personality went back to normal and remains unchanged, and she is rather uncooperative with respect to the protagonists. Despite wanting to be saved, she doesn’t want to face her problems and what’s in her own heart, so she maintains a noncommittal stance and just goes with the flow.
The reason Jinako lets her guard down a little when around the protagonist is that the protagonist is also an “ordinary person” like she is.
Self-centered through and through, and with a defeatist mentality, she is a worthless good for nothing in her x0s{{n1}}.
However, like Karna says, “Even snails have their own dignity.” In the end, although just barely, Jinako stands firm and tries to fulfill the minimum level of her responsibilities.
