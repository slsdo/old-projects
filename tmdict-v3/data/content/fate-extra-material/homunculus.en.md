Homunculus used to refer to babies that were created by alchemists in the old world, but that is all in the past now.
In the world of EXTRA homunculus and clone technology have become popular in underground society.
Such technology is forbidden by religious ethics, but due to the global birthrate decline which caused there to be a lack of manpower this unlawful technology has continued to thrive.
In areas controlled by the West Europe Plutocracy homunculus technology is considered unethical meaning it is unable to be used openly. However, in areas like Africa, the Middle East, and poor Asian countries, which lie outside of the Plutocracy’s sphere of control, the technology is used to mass produce low quality homunculus that are used as prostitutes, laborers, and for human organ sales.
The West Europe Plutocracy’s monopoly on resources has caused already poor countries to become even poorer which in turn leads them to use create homunculus as a way to obtain foreign capital and goods. This creates a vicious cycle where the poor countries sell their created organs and laborers which improves the Plutocracy’s labor force which in turn leads to the Plutocracy further profiting and solidifying their hold over the world.
Homunculus in the true sense of the word were only created at the Atlas Institute, but its doors have already been closed for all eternity.
