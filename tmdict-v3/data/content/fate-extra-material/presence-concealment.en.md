{{n1}}
A skill that conceals the user and their actions. Usually only used by fighting-type heroic spirits who do not specialize in magic.
To the Skull Assassin Hassan, this skill was his one and only advantage that no one could surpass, but EXTRA’s amazing Li Shuwen brings it back as a completely new method of concealment:
“By melding your breathing and nature into one, you become transparent.”
It’s a curious skill that makes people wonder:
“If it’s a skill that prevents you from being detected, isn’t it just the same thing as any other Presence Concealment?”
In CCC Passionlip is rather fond of using this skill, but when she moves her claws make sound scraping along the ground, and the enemy ends up finding her. So she can’t use it for much more than gazing at the protagonist from the shadows. Isn’t that wonderful?
