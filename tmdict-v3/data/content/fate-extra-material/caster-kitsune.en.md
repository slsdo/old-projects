Caster is one of the main Servants who can make a contract with the main protagonist.
She is always smiling and has quite the precocious tongue. She is the trademark beauty of Extra with those lovely fox ears. She is usually called Cas-ko.
Just as the class name Caster implies, she is a magic user specializing in curses. She also features a Japanese-style design. “I’m gonna curse you ☆!”
She refers to herself with 私 (watakushi). She is unreserved like a gal (gyaru), and when trying to be cute for a boy she uses アタシ (atashi).
Unusual for a Fate game, she is so smitten with the protagonist that you might do a double take,
“Did they really put this in?”
Her goal is to become the protagonist’s wife. She’s a realist and also devilishly cute in all areas unrelated to her goals or dreams.
She has a carefree attitude and always has love on the mind. She is an admittedly gal-esque Servant. However, fundamentally she is a logical realist. “Deity” is a system-like existence. Sometimes she slips up and blurts out lines which don’t suit her usual carefree mentality.
According to Red Saber “She puts up a loose airhead front, but that girl’s true nature is really sharp.”

Cas-ko’s true form is an anti-heroic spirit, God-class… she is more or less a god.
Having lost most of her power, she is now on the same level as other human heroic spirits, however when the number of her tails increases and her spirit rank goes up to the highest level, it’s impossible for humans to comprehend her full power. This is only natural, as the foundation of her being came from an offering to the sun. Thus, the scale of her existence is equivalent to that of the sun.
By the way, for each tail that returns, Cas-ko’s power increases by 9x. This means that in her max power state with all nine tails her power has increased by 99.
Supposing that we represent an A rank Servant with a numerical power level of, say, 100 (not including Noble Phantasms), Cas-ko with 1 tail has a power of about 9, and as you can see could never defeat an A rank Servant. But, as the number of tails increases… well it’s silly to even try comparing.
Her true name, which is something that should remain a secret, is quickly revealed from the start of the game. Having no interest in the Holy Grail War, and with a unique perspective of the world, she is clearly different from the other servants. Not to mention she is essentially a cheat character. She is the embodiment of a natural phenomenon: a god-class spirit. Why does she posses such a low spirit rank in game? Why does her behavior mimic that of humans? Please refer to her Special My Room to find out.

Despite being such a great god-class spirit, in the game she is the weakest Servant. With her paper thin armor and inability to use Noble Phantasms it’s an easy game-over if you let your guard down. I understand, I understand, if only the setting had been made so that she was your childhood friend, then she would’ve truly been the best character, right!?
In any case, I would like players who choose Cas-ko to have the resolve to surmount the border of life and death.
On the other hand, after Cas-ko’s stats are upgraded, the second half of the game is a sure-victory cakewalk, regardless if the enemy is a weakling or a boss. Just put all of the Soul Alteration points towards her magic power!
She likes trips to hot spring resorts (but not hot spring baths), and love-filled cooking (at least while doing the cooking), and giving presents to herself.
She hates dogs, only somewhat handsome guys, and people who disrupt her time alone with her Master.
She’s not too fond of loveable 100% airhead characters. She seems to have well learned the lesson that her half-baked airhead act never seems to come out ahead of the real deal.
Dear Cas-ko, what happened in your past?

In CCC Cas-ko appears featuring an S&M bondage style + Goth Loli dress fusion design. Even though she puts up a front pretending to dislike her attire she actually loves it, “As long as it’s cute, anything’s okay!”
The Heroic Spirit of Sweets doesn’t have the same pride that the other few Japanese style Servants do.
In CCC her rival is Passionlip.
Under normal circumstances Cas-ko is on the verge of death after taking a normal punch attack, so Lip’s huge one-shot attack means that she is an instant death monster as far as Cas-ko is concerned.
Furthermore, it seems that a narrow-minded tendency lingers from Passionlip’s yandere past, and this can prove to be quite irritating to Cas-ko.
Also, when talking about Cas-ko it’s impossible to skip over the amazing preferential treatment we gave her ending.
Who who imagine that she’d get a two CG ending event!? What is this recklessness?
And that ultra special final CG!!
Not to mention the ending differs depending on whether your character is male or female!
The “Say Aahhh” ending CG wasn’t in the plan from the start, but after a developer meeting it was decided that the final event CG would be the Tamamo Nine.
At that point we were short on time and budget but after consulting with Wada Arco we were able to make something out of nothing and helped us realize the “Say Aahhh” ending CG.
