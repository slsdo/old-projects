My Room refers to the private room given to each Master.
It is one of the few places where you can catch a break from the serious atmosphere of the Holy Grail War.
My Room is a completely private space, and anything that happens or is discussed inside will never be leaked or overheard.
Even though Moon Cell is also recording it, only under special circumstances can it be browsed.
By default it’s just a regular classroom, but depending on a Master’s codecast skills it can change in various ways.
The protagonist is unable to change the interior design, but someone on the level of Leo or Rin can completely customize everything.
Cas-ko’s room in CCC is missing the Yes/No pillows, and instead Agree/Disagree pillows have been unscrupulously implemented.
