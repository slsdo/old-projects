The Fortress of Impalement.
Lancer’s anti-army Noble Phantasm.
This is a Noble Phantasm derived from Vlad III’s posthumous title – Vlad the Impaler.
It’s a magic torture castle that pierces victims with magic lances which curse and deal heavy damage.
The pain caused by it increases depending on the immoral and deprave sins it’s victims have committed; it’s truly an attack of great justice.
In the game, like the screaming Mandragoras, countless lances burst out from under the feet of enemies and pierce them, causing huge damage.
Furthermore, the attacks apply the negative status effect “curse.”
The attack affects all enemy units, so its true value is only displayed in one vs. many situations rather than one-on-one.
Also, as a hidden component, Kazikli Bey’s damage is increased when used on people who qualify as “enforcement targets.”
If the enemy has committed the crimes of running away, immorality, or violence, Kazikli Bey’s destructive power increases. There is no extra damage when used against the protagonist because they have no criminal history.

At the time Vlad III was alive, punishing commoners with impalement wasn’t unusual in the Balkan Peninsula and Northern Mediterranean Sea areas.
But then, after Vlad III took up the role as Wallachia’s lord and leader for the second time, he became fed up with the extreme corruption and depravity of the nobles in his country.
He decided that the decline of Wallachia was due to these nobles, and took decisive action against unprecedented numbers of them. His primary method of enforcement and punishment was impalement.
In Wallachia, where nobles and commoners had previously been subject to very different treatment and rules, it’s presumed that Vlad’s actions were extremely shocking.
There was surely no one in the land who did not feel the severity and horror of Lord Vlad’s actions.
After routing the nobles, impalement became Vlad’s favorite method of punishment, and in 1459 he even went so far as to impale the emissary of the Ottoman Empire (Turkish Empire) alive, among other deeds.
