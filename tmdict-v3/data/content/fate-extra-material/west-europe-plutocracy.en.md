The economic organization headed by Harwey.
Harwey is effectively the king on Earth in EXTRA.
At a very early stage Harwey predicted that the world’s resources would run dry, and developed an unsuitably large fear of what might happen. He came up with the solution of carefully managing the north pole, and gave his undivided attention to it.
The foundation of his organization had a lot of religious power, and it’s speculated that the Holy Church helped him out because a huge amount of financial resources soon gathered under Harvey.
The defacto leader of the Holy Church in the world of EXTRA, Cardinal Laurentis, does have a good relationship with Harwey.
