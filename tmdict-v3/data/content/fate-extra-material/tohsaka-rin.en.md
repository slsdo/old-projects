Tohsaka Rin.
She is a Master who participates in the Holy Grail War.
She is a spiritron hacker who raises a voice of opposition against Harwey’s rule.
Her nationality is unknown, and she is currently active in the Middle East. She has a firm and unsentimental set of values, but her true nature is someone who looks out for others and pursues justice, so she is suspect to be sympathetic at the critical moment.
Red clothes, twin tails, and a miniskirt. She is a well-known heroine from Fate/stay night.
Previously she was a member of a United Nations organization, and was volunteering as a system management engineer of sorts for an NGO that provides medical assistance across Asia.
But Rin found herself losing faith in her dream and had many doubts about what the future would hold in a world ruled by the Harwey family. After visiting a broad range of countries that were suffering from poverty Rin could see the limits of such a strictly controlled society, and so she decided to fight back against Harwey.
After that she left the NGO and devoted herself to supporting the resistance.
From then on she fought alongside the resistance, however she operated completely independently. Her policy is to avoid civilian casualties.
For the past year she has resided in the strife-filled land of the Middle East. Half for her own conviction, and half for the sake of money, she engaged in cyber warfare against Harwey’s private army. Upon hearing about the Holy Grail War from the resistance, she formally accepted the mission to ascend to the Moon and defeat Harwey.
Her servant is Lancer.
Her specs as a magus are slightly inferior to Leo’s, but her ability as a Master exceeds Leo’s, which comes from her greater real-world combat experience. This makes Rin a top candidate for winning the Grail.

Rin also appears in CCC as a trustworthy advisor.
When you fall to the far side of the Moon at the end of the fifth round, you bump into Rin, whose consciousness has been taken over by BB, and she becomes your enemy.
After defeating Rin, she regains her sanity, and joins the student council as if to atone for her sins. From then on she acts as an Operator.
Rin’s room is filled with random stuff to the point where you might think she is a Red Doraemon. Rin comes up with most of the strategic plans for you each night.
Her position within the student council is vice-president. She is a great strategist, and supports your efforts to clear the Sakura Labyrinth.
She also deeps her relationship with Rani who similarly plays a support role, and in the latter half of the game Rin and Rani become good friends.
