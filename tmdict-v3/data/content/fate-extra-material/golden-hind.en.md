This is the boat that Rider sails on when she activates her Noble Phantasm. It’s Francis Drake’s beloved boat.
At a length of a little less than 37 meters, both the bow and stern of the ship each have 4 cannons, while the sides of the ship each have 14.
In this boat’s heyday the main form of naval combat was still boarding the enemy ship after smashing into it, but this boat’s design reflects the tactics used in the future battles of the Invincible Armada, by employing long range cannon battles. Standard pirate strategy revolves around forcing the target ship to surrender without damaging it, and then proceeding to board it. It seems that if the target ship could be intimidated into surrendering, these cannons were not used. 
The galleon’s original name was “The Pelican,” but Drake thought this name was lame (or at least ill-omened), so she changed it.
…This is why when someone mentions the name “The Pelican” to Rider she gets seriously ticked off, but her foolish anger is kind of cute.
