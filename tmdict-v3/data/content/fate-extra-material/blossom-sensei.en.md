The host of the Q&A corner.
She first appears in the *Fate/EXTRA Omake Theater* (Bonus Theater)
No matter how you look at it Blossom-sensei is actually Sakura, but she insistently refers to herself as Blossom-sensei. She seems to fall somewhere in between Sakura and BB.
Itâ€™s no exaggeration to say that one of the major reasons we could make CCC is because of the new super cute drawings of Sakura that the character designer Ms. Wada Aruko did for us.
By the way, when we were writing the scenario for the Omake Theater it had already been decided that we would be developing the sequel CCC. If you insistently persevere, your dream will come true! Something like the whim of a fungus{{n1}}.

1. {{note1}} Probably refers to Nasu Kinoko, who is often referred to as a fungus/mushroom.
