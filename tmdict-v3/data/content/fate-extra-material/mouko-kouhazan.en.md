Fierce Tiger Forcibly Climbs a Mountain.
This is the anti-gate Noble Phantasm that Berserker Li Shuwen used in battle.
It’s a secret Bajiquan technique that Li Shuwen relied on during his lifetime to bring certain death to his enemies.
When you think of Li Shuwen, this move is what first comes to mind. Sorry to keep you waiting. Here’s the attack everyone loves, Fierce Tiger Forcibly Climbs a Mountain.
No Second Strike is at best anti-unit… a strike used to stop the heart of a person, while this is an attack that specializes in physical damage.
It’s thought that Assassin turned Berserker started using Fierce Tiger Forcibly Climbs a Mountain as his Noble Phantasm because when he lost his sanity he probably also lost the ability to read the pulse and mentality of his opponents.
This Noble Phantasm is a flowing series of consecutive attacks, and the movement of the first attack resembles a tiger clawing at a mountain, hence it’s name.
Each blow consists of “energy from the Earth that has been redirected by the martial artist known as Li Shuwen.” This flurry of attacks easily destroys walls or doors, even including sturdy dojo gates, to say nothing about what would happen to a person.
