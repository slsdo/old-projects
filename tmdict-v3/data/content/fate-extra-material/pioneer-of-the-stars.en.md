Rider’s skill.
This is a special skill conferred upon the Heroic Spirit that triggered a major turning point in human history.
All difficult voyages and challenges which are considered “impossible” turn into “events that can be realized.”
A difficult journey that the measurement system of that era is one step short from enabling, to overcome it with normal human power alone.
