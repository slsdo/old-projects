The Atlas Institute is an association of magus and alchemists based somewhere in Egypt’s Atlas Mountains. It is also known as the Giant’s Pit.
Of the three divisions of what had once been the Mage’s Association, the institute of accumulation and measurement.
They were a group of practitioners of alchemy, not of the modern alchemy that became dominant since the medieval times, but the progenitor of magecraft, the alchemy that investigates the truth of the world.
They’re not so much as mages as they are individuals with abnormal powers who treat their own bodies like humanoid machines, using them like vessels for working their minds more accurately, more powerfully, more quickly.
They believed that humans are a rare sort of computers with motor functions (the five senses), that we humans are intelligent lifeforms that evolved to collect and analyze information and directly solve the problems created from that as manual labor.
The correctness of this idea was proven unexpectedly in the world of Extra where magecraft died out.
The alchemists of Atlas have poor magic circuits, and did not lead their lives relying on magic power.
As they did not rely on it (or to be more precise, could not), they were able to continue their pursuit of knowledge as disciples of magecraft even after the depletion of mana.
However, for a long time children had stopped being born, and the Atlas Institute, with its old alchemists taking their lives, was at the end of its ropes irrespective of the mana depletion.
All that remains of the Atlas Institute is a single homunculus. The last Atlasian succumbed to disease after creating the homunculus, and only her creations were left in her cave.
The Atlas alchemists disappeared, and their research facilities which were built using unknown techniques stretch out in an underground city which is now, more or less, a giant graveyard.
