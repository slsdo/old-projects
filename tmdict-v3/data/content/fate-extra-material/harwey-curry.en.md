This is a black colored curry that’s made in a big metal drum found at the back of the old School building. Julius is the one who makes it.
Its flavor can only be described as heavy and sticky, and its unrefined taste and substance feels like it’s going to stick in your stomach forever. The curry hasn’t even reached a level where you can debate if it is spicy or not, and frankly it’s probably just some coal tar.
Surprisingly, it tastes good if you eat it with watermelon.
This is even more digression, but among the members of the student council, the best one at cooking is Gatou Monji. His five-grain porridge is a masterpiece that even has Kiara coming back for seconds.
