One of Green Archer’s skills.
Before combat, during the preparation stage, this ability shaves off some of his enemies’ power. It’s the hallmark of a master of traps.
For one as capable as Green Archer is, if the stage is a forest (or somewhat wooded), before the enemy can even enter battle it is possible to reduce their combat potential or forces by 60%.
It is common sense in military strategy that, “Upon losing a third of your forces, you are no longer able to continue your operation.” This shows just how diabolic a scheme he managed to realize.
The higher this skill is leveled, the more it decreases the spirit level of the heroic spirit.
On a separate note, Green Archer lays traps to exterminate his enemies, while Red Archer just sees traps as an effective way of repelling his enemies.
