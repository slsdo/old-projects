This is the name of the final obstructing wall preventing the player from reaching Moon Cell’s core.
Its name is a challenge to morals.
In our initial design plans the name was Sakura Veil Diva.
We wanted players to pronounce “Diva” with a similar intonation to “Godiva.” Goddess Diva; abbreviated to Godiva.
…At the very end of the end we felt it was too much of a comedic relief, so Diva was changed to Grande.
