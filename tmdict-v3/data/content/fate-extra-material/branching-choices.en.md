These appear when some kind of reaction is desired with respect to what’s currently happening in the game.
You must choose just one option from the many possible actions.
Only when the branching choices appear is the flow of the story interrupted, and the player imposes his/her own decision and opinion in the place of the protagonist.
A situation where a “response” occurs during a conversation, all branching paths resulting from the “responses” have equal value, and we want you to reply as you think the protagonist would.
Choosing the silly replies is also one of EXTRA’s real pleasures.
Contrary to what you might think, the silly replies actually often bring out a hidden side of the characters.
