The organization responsible for investigating the Spiritual Tomb of Albion.
The organization is split into three parts: the Management Branch, responsible for overseeing the function of the entire organization; the Materials Branch, responsible for providing the tools necessary for the excavation and researching Albion itself; and the Excavation Branch which keeps records of the actual investigators.
Unlike most organizations in the Clock Tower, since it was set up in a way to prevent any one Lord from monopolizing it, the organization doesnâ€™t lend much weight to the bloodlines of those involved. Rather than magi, it would be more accurate to call them archaeological Spellcasters.
