Conductor of the Rail Zeppelin.
Since the Rail Zeppelin ran over leylines, there was a need to accurately perceive their ever-changing paths so that the tracks might follow them. So of course he possessed finely tuned senses, and the skills to manage unstable Magic Furnaces. 
In the Grand Roll incident, his ability to lead them to the outer layer of the Spiritual Tomb of Albion came from such skills.
