A seamster working for the Iselma family.
The dresses of the Princesses of Gold and Silver were made by his hands. His hair was tied up in a showy manner, and his speech was slow and faltering.
He was childhood friends with the true culprit Maio, as well as the Princesses of Gold and Silver and their attendant maids. He was aware of Maioâ€™s feelings for Diadra, the Princess of Gold, since long ago. When the true culprit was revealed, he must have been more shocked than anyone else.
