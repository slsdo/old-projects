The organization responsible for the management of the mining town of Magisfair within the Spiritual Tomb of Albion.
They possess a tremendous amount of data regarding the people and materials taken into Albion.
The number of entrances to Albion are incredibly few, and though each one is in the hands of the Management Department, the number of officially recognized excavators that attempt to sneak out Talismans from the Tomb is endless, thus necessitating their tight control.
And though the official entrances have been locked down, a number of portals leading from the Tomb to the surface have appeared, leading to a slew of disappearances and graverobbings.
