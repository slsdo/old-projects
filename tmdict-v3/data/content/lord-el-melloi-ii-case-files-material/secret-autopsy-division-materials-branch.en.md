The department responsible for creating the tools used in the excavation and exploration of Albion. Unlike most Workshops, because they must mass produce the same items over and over, a number of magi’s Workshops have been combined to create the “Composite Workshop Criegula.” Apparently, this Criegula also once made witch’s tools or something.
In addition, this division is also responsible for actually progressing research into Albion. Since the disappearance of the criminal Gazamy at the end of the last century, Albion has continued to undergo extreme changes, working this department down to the bone.
