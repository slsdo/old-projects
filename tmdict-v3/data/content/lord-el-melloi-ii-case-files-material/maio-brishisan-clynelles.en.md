A pharmacist working for the Iselma family.
Though he didn’t especially stand out as a student of the Faculty of Lore, that was obviously because he spent almost his entire life for the sake of Iselma’s research. 
His faint feelings for his childhood friend were something unsuited to a magus. As such, when El-Melloi II exposed how he had been so dominated by such half-hearted worldly desires, his feelings of guilt drove him to despair.
