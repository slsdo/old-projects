A guest on the Rail Zeppelin. A magus who uses spiders.
Despite being a magus, he is a media celebrity, being the star of the show *Jeanmario Spinerraâ€™s Zombie Cooking*, which won popularity across Great Britain. Using the wealth procured from his television show, he hoped to purchase a set of Mystic Eyes from the Rail Zeppelin with which he would get back on the easy path for magecraft, but alas it was not to be. Apparently, having used his new connection with Adashino Hishiri, he continued to pop up here and there around the Clock Tower after the incident.
