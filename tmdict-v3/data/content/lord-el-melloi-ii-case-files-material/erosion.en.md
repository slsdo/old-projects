{{n1}}
A Mystic Code in the form of a dagger, passed down in Gray’s hometown.
According to legend, it was handed down to them by the Black Madonna, to be kept until the time of King Arthur’s return. The blade itself possesses the ability to separate the mind and soul from the flesh. It was intended to separate Gray’s mind and soul from her body, allowing the spirit of King Arthur to inhabit her body in the final stages of the ritual.
