Though he doesn’t appear in this work, the name of Lord El-Melloi II’s professor comes up numerous times.
The previous Lord El-Melloi. The Lord of Mineralogy. After establishing his status as a prodigy by reaching the rank of Pride in his teens, he went on to achieve the rank of Brand in his twenties. From the development of Volumen Hydrargyrum which was recognized as a Supreme Mystic Code, to his betrothal to the daughter of the Lord of Spiritual Evocation, his life could be described as little more than smooth sailing.
But, that was only true until he participated in the Fourth Holy Grail War.
Expecting the Grail War to be just another obvious victory to add to his long list of accomplishments, he gathered numerous Mystic Codes before setting out, only to tragically fail and lose everything.
The name of the Spellcaster that destroyed both his Magic Circuits and his Source Crest was Emiya Kiritsugu.
Later, the Sealing Designated man Heartless brought to the Divine Spirit Iskandar’s ritual was a magus of the name Emiya, his father. Finding the name of the one who killed his teacher at the end of Volume 8 must have been like a shot through the heart to El-Melloi II.
