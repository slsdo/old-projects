The trump card of the Rail Zeppelin.
Using the main car Rircapello, and the Spiritual Nature Regression-type Lense Roseeye, it pushes the abilities of a given Mystic Eye to its limits.
By pushing them to the absolute limits, it completely incinerates the Mystic Eye in question to exhibit a power that is hundreds to thousands of times it’s normal capabilities. Super weapons are quite romantic, don’t you think?
