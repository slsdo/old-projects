The master of Flueger, residing with the Spiritual Tomb of Albion.
One of the survivors.
At the hands of a certain mercenary magus, his Magic Circuits and Magic Crest were destroyed, after which he returned to the Tomb. Content to bear the title of a traitorous disciple, Flueger assisted his master in faking his death.
The source of his tenacity was his desire to stand triumphant over the chosen ones of the Clock Tower.
Once Lord El-Melloi II, the one who could be called at the top of those chosen ones, bowed his head in deference to him, he at long last felt he had been repaid for the trials of his life, and he agreed to cooperate.
