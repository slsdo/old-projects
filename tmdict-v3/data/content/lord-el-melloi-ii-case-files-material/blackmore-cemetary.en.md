The cemetary from Gray’s hometown.
The land protected by Bersac Blackmore.
Originally, the land was inhabited by a family of magi that manipulated spirits, and regarded birds as sacred. The name Blackmore is apparently drawn from a powerful Dead Apostle connected to this family. Though the Dead Apostle in question perished some two thousand years ago, the family took his name as a sign of respect for him. At this point, that family’s original name is no longer known.
At any rate, that family has now become one of gravekeepers, and though temporarily, they have been entrusted with the remains of King Arthur.
