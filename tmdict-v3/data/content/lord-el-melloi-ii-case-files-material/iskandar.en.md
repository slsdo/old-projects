The King of Conquerors, Iskandar. Also known as Alexander the Great.
A great Heroic Spirit, whose exploits were only matched by a small handful of others across the entirety of human history.
Summoned in the Fourth Holy Grail War under the class of Rider, he was the Servant of Waver Velvet. His Noble Phantasms were Gordius Wheel, the Wheel of Heaven’s Might, on which Faker’s “Hecatic Wheel” was based, as well as the Rank EX Ionian Hetairoi, Army of the King, which could summon forth tens of thousands of Heroic Spirits.
Though he never really appeared in Case Files himself, his influence was enormous.
Even Heartless himself had an undeniable eye for him. Due to his great exploits in life, some say he was chosen by the twelve historical Gods of Olympus{{n1}}…Heartless’ plan began from that anecdote.
Though it can’t be said whether the words Gray heard at the end of Case Files truly belonged to him or not, the resurrection of the box in her hands was unquestionably a miracle.

##### {{notes}}
