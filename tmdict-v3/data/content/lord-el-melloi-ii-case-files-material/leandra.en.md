The auctioneer of the Rail Zeppelin.
One who knew the former owner. While riding the train of the Dead Apostle, she was responsible for moving hundreds of millions of dollars worth of money, which was thought to be a cause of significant anxiety for her.
In the original plans, her right hand had a large number of Mystic Eyes implanted within it to aid in the process of transplanting, but it was never shown in the story.
