{{n1}}
Lord of the Faculty of Spiritual Evocation.
Perhaps due to belonging to the Faculty of Spiritual Evocation, which manipulates untold numbers of spirits, he also gives the impression of a dead man. In Grand Roll, he demonstrated a level of power on par with that of the Lord of Trambelio, Magdanel, and Inorai.
The offering of his daughter Sola-Ui for a political marriage demonstrated his expectations for Kayneth, who died during the Fourth Holy Grail War.
