The name given to the field of magecraft that utilizes one’s bestial nature.
While this magecraft eats at the minds of those of the Glascheit family, many other forms of it are more mild. For example, enhancing one’s sense of smell to be like that of a dog, enhancing one’s legs to run as fast as a horse, or enhancing one’s eyes to see in the dark like a cat.
Possession by a fox or a dog god, famous in Japan, are also examples of this magecraft.
