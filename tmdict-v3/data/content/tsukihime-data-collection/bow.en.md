Ciel’s alias within the Burial Agency.
The name comes from the fact that her Christian name is Ciel, and she’s the only person in the Burial Agency that fights using firearms.
…Well, it was also due to the scenario director’s foolish blunder.
He knew that “arc-en-ciel” meant “rainbow” in French, but he mixed up which word meant what, hahaha.
He only noticed his mistake a little bit before the Half-moon edition went on sale, when he was listening to a song by a certain band.
The song was titled “ciel,” and was about the sky.
Honestly, it was kind of irritating, but at that point the scenario was already complete, and changing Ciel’s name so late into development didn’t feel right. In the end, he just tried to push through and finish without thinking about it too much.
