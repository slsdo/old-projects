The conceptual armament that Ciel is authorized to carry. An iron hammer created by Christianity in order to renounce the heretical doctrine of reincarnation.
…Although, if reincarnation didn’t really exist then it seems like it would be kind of unnecessary to prepare an anti-reincarnation weapon, right?
Originally created by felling a miraculous beast said to consume souls, then using its horn as a key. The surface of the horn is inscribed with tightly-packed complaints about how “reincarnation is really lame.”
It was sanctified over the course of many years, but eventually fell into Ciel’s hands.
“A horn!? That’s not practical at all. The higher-ups are totally out of touch!”
Unable to hold herself back, she set about improving it.
At any rate, since it’s been almost a thousand years since it was first created, it even has an elemental living within it… though the essence of its personality may have been a bit warped by Ciel’s remodeling.
