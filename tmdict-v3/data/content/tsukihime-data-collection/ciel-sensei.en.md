Administrator of the Tsukihime Help Corner.
The fact that she fits even better here than in the main story is almost frightening. As for why it’s Ciel, well, basically we figured if we could turn an older-sister type character into the current Ciel, then turning the half-baked upperclassman Ciel into a teacher should be fine.
Incidentally, for a while we couldn’t decide if we wanted the host of the help corner to be a teacher, or a child version of Shiki.
The art director ended up unilaterally making the decision all on his own, authoritatively declaring “You know, Ciel seems kind of like a teacher.” Then even though we were swamped with work at the time, he somehow ended up drawing a bunch of character artwork for Ciel-sensei anyway. Of course, we couldn’t very well half-ass things after that, so we were basically forced to throw ourselves into covering all the possible ending patterns.
Oh, and I forgot to mention, this happened two days before the final test play. We barely finished!
