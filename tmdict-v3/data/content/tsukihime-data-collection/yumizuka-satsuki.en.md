Shiki’s classmate. Her nickname is Sacchin.
She is a pitiable girl, who had been Shiki’s classmate several times since middle school, but never managed to capture his attention.
Since she wasn’t even a sub-heroine, we endeavored to give as plain a design as possible.
Just like Nrvnqsr, she didn’t appear in Old Tsukihime. (Though, she did exist as a fellow classmate).
At one point, the scenario director actually did scribble out a few barebones rough drafts for a pretty amazing Sacchin route, but in the end he decided the game was flashy enough already and reconsidered.
…By the way, that athletics storeroom with a door that always jams is actually something that exists in real life. There are even students that got stuck inside it, too.
Also, while we’re on the topic, allow me to explain what the club captain meant when she said keeping what happened quiet was a matter of the club’s survival, since it wasn’t very clear in the story itself. Basically, at Shiki’s middle school, students were constantly warned to be careful around the old storeroom. If a teacher found out that a group of students had disregarded those warnings and gotten stuck inside, there would be hell to pay.
And, since the badminton club only had six members, it would almost certainly be used as a pretext to abolish the club on the spot.
Though it seems that after Sacchin graduated, it was converted into a lacrosse club anyway.
…What a cutthroat school, huh?
