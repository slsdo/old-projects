As their name suggests, they are a lineage of shrine maidens. Similar to the Nanaya, they pass down special abilities to their children. However, they do not do so through blood, but rather the transmission of skills and knowledge.
The woman who inherits the Fujou name is destined to lose her sight, for being unable to see the material world comes hand in hand with the ability to peer into the world of spirits.
Hisui and Kohaku both came from a branch of this family.
Unlike the Fujou, this branch did pass on their abilities through blood. However, Hisui and Kohaku’s mother violated a taboo and the branch fell into ruin, which led to the two children being taken in by Tohno Makihisa.
