One of the heroines in *Tsukihime*, and probably the strongest, most incorrigible character in the story.
She is a True Ancestor, born in the 12th Century for the sole purpose of hunting those True Ancestors that had fallen and become demon lords.
After flushing out all of the Fallen Ancestors, she was commanded to start hunting Dead Apostles as well. However, when Roa tricked her into drinking his blood, she went berserk and wiped out most of the few remaining True Ancestors, prompting her to seal herself within the reality marble known as the Millennium Castle Brunestud. From that point on, she left the castle only to hunt down and execute Roa every time he reincarnated.
She is the princess of the True Ancestors, and used to have much longer hair than she does now. The reason for its current length is not because she cut it herself, but because it was stolen from her during a battle with the Dead Apostle Altrouge.
She was originally conceived of as a “pure and noble vampire,” but this concept seems to have been altered at some point in time. The responsibility for that lies entirely with the character designer. After seeing the smiling face he drew, even the scenario director’s mental image of her began to change.
Of course, as a result she became the airheaded funny vampire everybody knows and loves, so it worked out all right in the end. I actually kind of like her smile the best out of everyone.
By the way, this is a secret but even though she’s the main heroine she actually showed up the least out of everybody.
