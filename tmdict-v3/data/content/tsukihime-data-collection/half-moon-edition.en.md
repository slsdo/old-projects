The version of *Tsukihime* sold at the 2000 Summer Comiket.
It was called the “Half-moon edition” because only the Arcueid and Ciel routes were included.
All the scenarios were already completed, and even the art was finished. However, the scripting still needed some work, so regretfully we were forced to cut the Akiha and Hisui routes.
This Half-moon edition came bundled with various extras.
For instance, a digital comic by Takeuchi, bonus artwork, a coupon for 500 yen off the final release, and a separate collection of setting material.
Of course, the most notable thing it came with was a countless number of typos and omitted words, hahaha.
…Wait, I guess that’s not that funny.
