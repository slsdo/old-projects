A sub-heroine in *Tsukihime*. A servant working at the Tohno mansion. Sympath.
An energetic girl, that always sports a bright, unwavering smile. In the story, she was the servant assigned to Akiha, and was in charge of cooking and tending to the gardens.
She has a natural cheerfulness about her, and just spending time with her is relaxing. On the other hand, she is also very cool-headed and intelligent—though she isn’t even aware of it herself.
She was taken in by Tohno Makihisa together with Hisui, and spent her days confined in Makihisa’s room.
Around the time that Akiha entered her second year of middle school—after Shiki was put up for adoption—she found out about Kohaku’s relationship with Makihisa and made her a normal servant working on the mansion grounds.
As a character, she represents “the lower ruling the higher.”
She was supposed to be a sub-character to the bitter end, but could end up being the most popular of all if we’re not careful.
Now, this is supposed to be a secret, but originally Kohaku didn’t even have a route.
What changed that, you ask? Well, after we released the Half-moon edition we read through the player feedback, and the one thing that almost everybody mentioned was that Kohaku needed a route too.
……Of course, there was some resistance. As far as the scenario director was concerned, Hisui and Kohaku were a paired set, so something like individual routes was totally impossible, and on top of that the scenario programming and event graphics for the Hisui and Akiha routes still weren’t even finished even though the winter Comiket was only three months away! It was only due to the art director’s passionate arguments that we decided to attempt the impossible in the end.
