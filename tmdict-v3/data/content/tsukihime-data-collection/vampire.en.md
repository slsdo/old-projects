A general term for those that suck human blood.
Refers specifically to the Dead Apostles, or those that have become bloodsuckers because of them.
The vampires in *Tsukihime* extract human blood to maintain their own flesh. If, during this process, the vampire injects their own blood into their human prey, that human will be unable to peacefully pass away.
For a normal person, death will still find them before long regardless. However, on rare occasions, if the victim has high physical potential and the capacity of their soul is excellent, they will remain in the world of the living.
Afterward, their corpse is buried, and left alone for several years. During this time their brain melts, their soul is liberated from the cage of the body, and eventually they arise as a ghoul.
As a ghoul, they feed on the corpses sleeping in the graves around them to supplement their own missing flesh, restoring their physical body little by little.
After many years of this, they will eventually regain their brain and intelligence. At this stage they can finally be called a vampire.
However, although this new vampire is free now, they cannot escape the rule of their sireâ€™s blood.
Finally, after spending decades acclimating to life in the darkness, the vampire will begin attacking humans to create servants of their very own, while remaining subservient to the vampire that made them.
The Church exists to obstruct this infinite cycle. Their ultimate goal is the utter elimination of all vampires, and the sealing of the 27 Ancestors that made them.
