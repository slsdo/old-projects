Shiki’s catchphrase. Repeated every time he’s thrust into a new situation, and really implies wanting the reader themselves to understand the situation
Probably said over 100 times throughout *Tsukihime*, if you include Shiki’s monologues.
It was the catchphrase of the first-generation Shiki from *Kara no Kyoukai*, and *Tsukihime*’s Shiki inherited it from her. However, it seems that even the scenario director was surprised by how well it suited him.
Incidentally, even though we finally finished working on *Tsukihime* and should be taking time off to relax, for some reason we’re making this book instead.
I don’t understand…
