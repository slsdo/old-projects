A mystery distinct from magecraft.
“Magic” is that which makes the impossible into the possible, for a given era.
In the past, when civilization was young, most magi were also magicians.
However, in the present era where almost anything has become possible (so long as you disregard the capital and time required to realize it, and focus only on whether or not a thing is “possible” in the purest sense), the number of things that can be called “magic” has been reduced to a mere five.
Consequently, there are only five existing magicians.
Because the ultimate goal of magi is to arrive at magic, there is a possibility that this number may increase, but probably it will just keep dropping even more from here on out.
