An enchantment imbued upon Ciel’s favorite throwing swords.
Spell engravings are applied to the blade, causing targets to burst into flames after being pierced.
Because it is an effect generated with magecraft, very few Executors make use of it. However, for some reason or another Ciel isn’t a believer of the faith at all, so she makes use of magecraft with impunity.
In truth, it seems this is also part of the knowledge that she inherited from Roa. Aside from the Cremation Rite, there is also the Internment Rite, which turns the target into stone, the Mummification Rite, which desiccates the target, and the Excarnation Rite, which causes countless crows to descend upon the target.
