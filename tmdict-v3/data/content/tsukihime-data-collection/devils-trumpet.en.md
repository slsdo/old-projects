Another name for Datura metel. Kohaku grows it in the back yard.
Despite being used for “that,” it was nonchalantly, earnestly, and boldly put on display.
By the way, when Kohaku said she wanted to grow some cacti as well, she was probably talking about Peyote. Watch out, Shiki! It’s another dangerous plant!
