A knight that lives only for revenge.
One of the protagonists of *Tsukihime 2*.
Because some part of him still exists as a human, the nerves in his right hand are destroyed every time he uses his demonic sword. Because he is a Dead Apostle, his left hand rots when he uses his Holy Burial Artillery Scripture.
As for who performs maintenance on the Artillery Scripture, well, of course it’s “that person.”
———Six vampires gathered in the English countryside, in order to flush out the last True Ancestor. They were Dead Apostle Ancestors, one and all, bound by a pact of nonaggression. But little did they know that the Knight of Vengeance in their ranks was burning with ambition and treachery.
Suddenly, an ambush! It was the protector of the Princess, the god of death, Shiki the Killer. In order to further his own goals, the Knight of Vengeance had struck a deal with Shiki in private.
…It’s a tense sort of setting where two mortal enemies are nevertheless cooperating with each other for reasons unknown.
Oh, by the way, *Tsukihime 2* will be a light gun arcade game like House of the Dead 2. GOOOOOLDMAAAAAN!!!
