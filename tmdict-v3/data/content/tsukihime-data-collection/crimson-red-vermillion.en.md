The name for when those with inhuman heritage have drawn out their dormant blood to the maximum possible extent. Once they reach this state, they are enveloped in a mirage-like haze and can never return to being human.
The name Crimson Red Vermilion is unique to the families ruled over by the Tohno household. Elsewhere, it is known as Ancestral Return.
