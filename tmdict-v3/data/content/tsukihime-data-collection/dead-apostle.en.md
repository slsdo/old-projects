The bloodsuckers that make up the vast majority of the subcategory of bloodsuckers known as vampires.
…That was a confusing sentence!
Originally they were meals for the True Ancestors, who would prepare humans in advance for the times when their vampiric impulse became impossible to control. Of course, to keep them from escaping, the True Ancestors sucked their blood and brought them under their control.
These humans who had their blood sucked by the True Ancestors in turn began to suck blood themselves. Though, in their case it was mostly as a means of survival. After all, it stands to reason that the apostles serving the extremely long-lived True Ancestors must be possessed of similarly long lives as well.
However. At some point, after sucking the blood of others for such a long time, they began to feel a sense of superiority from the very act of sucking blood itself. They strengthened their abilities, their will, and eventually escaped from the control of the True Ancestors into the world of man, where they repeated the act of drinking blood over and over again to maintain their existences.
This is the origin of the bloodsuckers formed from humans, the Dead Apostles.
The Dead Apostles that escaped the True Ancestors the earliest are known as the 27 Ancestors. Though some of those 27 have been replaced over the generations, there are also those that still reign as Ancestors even now.
In the story, Sacchin was lucky enough to have a body blessed with excellent potential, and completed her rebirth into a bloodsucker in under half a day. It wouldn’t be wrong to say her potential as a vampire is close to that of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors of old.
