Head of the Burial Agency. Not the same Narbareck that was talking to Roa.
Itâ€™s said that the administrator of the Burial Agency is always a member of this family. The current Narbareck is apparently a homicidal maniac.
She regularly bullies all the members of the Burial Agency when they return from missions, and in turn they all hate her to the point that they basically all wish she would just drop dead.
Geez, what a bloodthirsty workplace.
