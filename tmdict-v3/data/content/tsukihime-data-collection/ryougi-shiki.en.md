The protagonist of *Kara no Kyoukai*. Able to see lines of death, just like Tohno Shiki.
The last name “Ryougi” and first name “Shiki” both have an appropriate meaning. Consequently as a user of the mystic eyes of death perception it can be said she is several ranks higher than Tohno Shiki.
Tohno Shiki is pretty much her polar opposite. In fact, his personality is actually close to Kokutou Mikiya’s.
If you called her Tohno Shiki’s prototype, I wouldn’t know how to answer.
Because, even though as a completed work *Kara no Kyoukai* predates *Tsukihime* by two years, I had the idea for *Tsukihime* first.
However, at the time the idea refused to become a story, so I stored it away and came back to it later when I finally made *Tsukihime* for real.
Before that, though, I ended up making something completely different, only keeping the protagonist from the original idea. The resulting work was *Kara no Kyoukai*.
Geez, I never imagined I’d end up working with the same “lines of death” idea for three whole years…
