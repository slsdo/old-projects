One of the heroines in *Tsukihime*. No boobs. Shiki’s younger sister, and the Tohno family’s heir.
She has long black hair and a dignified posture, firm speech, and a less than endearing personality. On top of that, her love of strict discipline can make her somewhat hard to get along with.
Perhaps it’s because she doesn’t think much of the way Shiki lived doing whatever he pleased for eight years, but she lashes out at him every chance she gets.
Though she is basically straightforward and honest at her core, she is also unyielding and hates losing, so her true personality rarely gets a chance to shine.
She was one of the people involved in the accident eight years ago, after which her dormant Tohno blood was awakened.
Though she would have been able to suppress it if she only had to worry about herself, she was carrying the burden of two people. As a result, she started being attacked by seizures nearly every night, and at Kohaku’s suggestion began drinking blood to maintain her body.
…Of course, it was all just a scheme to push Akiha closer to her Tohno nature. Probably, even Akiha herself was aware of it on some level.
In one of the routes, she ended up inverting and demonstrating her power to its fullest extent. That dreadful form, with its fluttering vermilion hair, is probably capable of exceeding even a rampaging Arcueid.
Long ago, in the Tohno’s country, there lived a female oni named Momiji. Though she is not their ancestor, maybe you could consider her the origin of Akiha?
Incidentally, Akiha is the character with the greatest number of individual sprites. It actually made the art director break down in tears. Not only were there uniform sprites and casual sprites, but sprites for Akiha when she was inverted as well.
Also, by some strange twist of fate, her roommate at school actually had the last name “Tsukihime.”
