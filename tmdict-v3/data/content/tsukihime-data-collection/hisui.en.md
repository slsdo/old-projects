A sub-heroine in *Tsukihime*. A servant working at the Tohno mansion. Sympath.
She is a maid who sports an apathetic expression and an inflexible attitude.
Though she seems to be the exact opposite of her older sister Kohaku in that regard, if you look carefully you can see she’s actually demonstrating a wide variety of subtle expressions.
Compared to Kohaku, who only ever wears an expression of “happiness,” Hisui actually seems much more human.
She has been working as a servant ever since she was taken in by the Tohno family as a child.
After Shiki left the mansion, she began working there, and stopped talking to people of her own accord.
She’s a bit ashamed of it, but it seems that even though she tries her best to maintain conduct befitting a servant when she’s in Shiki’s presence, every once in a while her true colors slip out.
Just as Kohaku has absolutely no sense for keeping things tidy and in order, Hisui’s palate is hellishly out of sync with most people’s. The reason she never cooks for Shiki is because she doesn’t want to make him sad.
…Geez, that’s so cute. I want a maid like that!
