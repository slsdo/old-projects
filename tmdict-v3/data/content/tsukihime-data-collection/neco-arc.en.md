Ciel-sensei’s student. Originally a feline, but it’s hard to say if this thing can even be called a cat anymore.
In class, she constantly acts up in retaliation for having such little screen time.
Details are unknown, but it seems she wants people to think she’s smart.
…Of course, the Arcueid in the main story wasn’t smart, either, she just had grandmotherly wisdom.
