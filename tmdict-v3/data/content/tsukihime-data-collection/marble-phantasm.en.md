Imagination Materialization. As the name suggests, it is the ability to manifest anything you can imagine. I really wish I could do this.
It is the ability possessed by elementals, which are the sense of touch of the natural world. By connecting their will directly to the world, they are able to transfigure the world into whatever environment they imagine.
Of course, the level of manifestation varies depending on the scale of the elemental, and it goes without saying that only nature can be transfigured—things that exist independently of nature are immune.
In *Tsukihime*, Arcueid eliminated Roa by using marble phantasm to turn the layers of the atmosphere in the hallway into a vacuum, like a carving knife slicing up a daikon radish.
Though she could not affect Roa himself, it was impossible for him to avoid the finely sliced atmosphere, and he was reduced to nothing but ankles. (The gap above the floor was the result of a deficiency in Arcueid’s imagination.)
Also, it is assumed that in the world of *Tsukihime* there exists another world on top of the normal world, things like legendary lands and countries of eternal spring, products of the imagination of the fairies that rule over this alien world. Consequently, it is possible for humans to wander into them by accident.
The castle in the mountains that Arcueid calls home is actually a product of her marble phantasm.
