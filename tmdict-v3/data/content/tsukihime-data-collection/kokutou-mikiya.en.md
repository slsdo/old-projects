The secondary protagonist of *Kara no Kyoukai*.
He doesn’t have a single special ability to his name. A completely normal young man in every respect. Both his outward appearance and personality are plain. His trademark look is black-rimmed glasses.
Other than that, there’s not much to him. Personality-wise, he’s the prototype for Tohno Shiki.
Although he isn’t strong, he’s definitely the strongest person of all. For some reason, he’s extremely talented at finding things and nothing else.
Also, though their personalities are similar, Tohno Shiki is still a child compared to Mikiya.
