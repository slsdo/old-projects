One of the five existing Magicians. It seems she hates the alliteration in her full name, and gets mad when people call her by it.
Though she is relatively affable in *Tsukihime*, she is actually a merciless person.
As for why she’s a Magician, it’s because she arrived there at the end of a long and arduous road. If that’s not a clear answer for you, please refer to *Kara no Kyoukai*. Well, it might still be unclear even if you do that, though…
She had such a large influence on the young Shiki that to this day she is the only person he calls “Sensei.”
Though her appearance seems to be the spitting image of the inverted Akiha, the truth is she actually has black hair.
…Wait, wouldn’t that make her even more like Akiha!?
Within the Association, she is known as the Magic Gunner, Miss Blue. Her abilities as a magus are below average, but there are none more talented when it comes to destruction.
