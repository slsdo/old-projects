Arcueid’s familiar. A succubus. Normally found hanging around Arcueid in the form of a black cat.
She is a succubus that can enter other people’s dreams, and is responsible for causing the wet dream Shiki had about Arcueid, Ciel, Akiha, or Hisui.
Though she does not appear in the original work, she is a young girl of about ten years old.
She has calm expressions, and wears a black coat with a big ribbon in her hair. It’s no exaggeration to say that her charm is enough to completely overshadow the other heroines.
She even had character illustrations and sex scenes finished and ready to go, but in the end they didn’t make it in.
She was going to be a secret heroine in *Tsukihime*, but we had to throw that idea out due to scheduling issues.
If you happen to have a copy of the bonus book that came packaged with the Half-moon edition, you can actually see her listed on the sub-characters page.
