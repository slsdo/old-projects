{{n1}}
The version of Shiki when his mind goes blank and he starts seriously fighting for his life.
Or, one of the protagonists of *Tsukihime 2*.
The Mystic Eye Killers alone must have become unable to suppress his death perception, because he always has both eyes covered by bandages.
……That said, you know the game is never getting made, right?

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Literally Shiki the Killer.
