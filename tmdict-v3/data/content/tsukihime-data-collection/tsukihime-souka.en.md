A student enrolled at the Asagami Academy for Girls. Akiha is her roommate and mentor. Her tone of speech is incredibly stern, and she always tries to be as succinct as possible.
Her outward appearance is that of a petite, charming young girl, but according to Akiha she has the personality of a handsome man. However, she’s not a girl that’s cool like a man, she’s just a stylish girl.
Her development progressed far enough that she even had sprites prepared, but unfortunately she ended up not appearing in Tsukihime at all.
