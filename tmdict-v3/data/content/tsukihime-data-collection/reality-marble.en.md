Intrinsic Bounded Field.
Originally referred to the alien common sense possessed by the beings called demons, but now also includes the unique boundary fields possessed by many others.
A subspecies of marble phantasm, it erodes reality and gives form to the user’s imagined world.
Unlike marble phantasm, however, the form of a reality marble cannot be freely adjusted. It is the manifestation of the user’s one-and-only self, after all, so appending their own will on top of its form is impossible.
On the other hand, since even things that are not part of nature can be influenced, perhaps it is actually even more amazing than marble phantasm, in a way.
Properly speaking, it is an ability unique to elementals and demons, but given enough time it is possible for some advanced practitioners to complete a magecraft to give shape to their personal imagined world and create a reality marble of their own.
Of course, if anything that isn’t an extension of nature like an elemental creates an alien world, the world itself will crush it. As a result, the upkeep of a reality marble requires a vast amount of energy, and most individuals are only capable of using one for a few minutes at a time.
Possessed by Dead Apostle Ancestors.
By the way, Nrvnqsr was able to escape the corrective influence of the world by using his reality marble within his own body.
Way to go, Professor Chaos.
