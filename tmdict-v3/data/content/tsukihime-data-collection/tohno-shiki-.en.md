The true eldest son of the Tohno family.
He was always pretty talkative and brash, but after Roa surfaced he got even chattier.
His having a different appearance in the Arcueid and Akiha routes is just a little bit of fan service.
After all, the only real difference between the two is whether or not Roa or SHIKI’s consciousness is stronger, but we thought it would be pretty terrible if the player had to keep seeing the same face pop up over and over as the villain in a game as long as *Tsukihime*, so we gave them different sprites.
By the way, since Akiha is “Aki (Autumn),” his nickname among the staff is “Haruo (Spring Boy).”
