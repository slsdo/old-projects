Aoko’s older sister. She studied magecraft under her grandfather, but murdered him over the shock of having the Aozaki inheritance usurped by her younger sister and fled to the Association. Unlike Aoko, her abilities as a magus are top class. She has even received a sealing designation due to her status as the world’s greatest puppet master.
She does not appear in *Tsukihime*. However, she is a key figure in *Kara no Kyoukai*, which intersects with *Tsukihime*.
Tohno Shiki’s mystic eye sealing glasses originally belonged to her.
She is merciless, just like Aoko. Honestly, do these Aozaki folk not have a single decent person among them?
