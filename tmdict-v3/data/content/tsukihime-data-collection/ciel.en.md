One of the heroines in *Tsukihime*. An unidentified, mysterious upperclassman. Glasses.
She is the newest member of the Church’s inquisition force, the Burial Agency, and is tasked with punishing the Dead Apostle Roa.
She infiltrated Shiki’s school because she suspected him of being Roa’s reincarnation, but in the process of observing him she ended up being charmed by him instead.
It wasn’t something as simple as falling in love, of course. It’s just that she was moved by the fact that Shiki could lead such a carefree life despite having experienced death just like she had.
Due to a certain contradiction, she is an existence that cannot die no matter what happens. She is trying to destroy Roa in order to resolve this state of affairs.
She has excellent reflexes, and is number seven in the Burial Agency despite her young age.
In the Church, where magecraft is officially forbidden, the knowledge of magecraft she inherited from Roa is regarded as highly useful. However, Ciel herself hates drawing on Roa’s knowledge.
Within the Burial Agency she is known as “Bow,” due to her preference for using projectile weapons.
She fights using all sorts of projectiles—not just throwing swords, but guns as well. In fact, the one responsible for changing the Seventh Holy Scripture from a beast’s horn into its current shape was actually Ciel. It’s possible she went a little overboard with the customizations.
Before she was part of the Burial Agency, she was the daughter of a baker. Her dream was to become a cake maker.
Believe it or not, she was originally conceived of as an older-sister type character.
Her design was hard to pin down, too. Every time we were close to making a decision, it would suddenly change again.
By the way, apparently the reason she likes curry so much has something to do with her very first mission.
