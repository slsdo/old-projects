It goes without saying, this is the protagonist Shiki’s room.
Since Shiki is Akiha’s older brother, you’d expect this to be a mighty fine room, but… do my eyes deceive me? It’s even more barren than Kohaku’s! What’s going on!?
If somebody unfamiliar with Shiki’s personality (and the way he doesn’t really keep a lot of stuff) saw it, they’d be convinced it was a case of the sister-in-law (Akiha) bullying the bride (Shiki).
Of course, since Shiki himself seems perfectly pleased with it, there’s no problem.
Also, though you can’t tell from the background graphic in the game, there’s a fireplace and a desk in the room as well, among other things.
