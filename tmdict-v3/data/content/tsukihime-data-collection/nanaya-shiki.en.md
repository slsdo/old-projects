Eldest son of the Nanaya, a clan of demon hunters that passed down psychic power as their genetic inheritance.
The Nanaya had retired from the demon hunting trade to live a quiet life in the mountains. However, because Tohno Makihisa still regarded them as dangerous, they were raided and completely wiped out.
Shiki, too, was very nearly killed by Makihisa, but somehow he narrowly escaped death and was taken in by the Tohno family as an adopted child.
Though Shiki doesn’t remember it, he had received basic training before Makihisa’s attack.
This training was responsible for turning Shiki into a transcendent killer every time he was backed into a corner during *Tsukihime*… somehow.
