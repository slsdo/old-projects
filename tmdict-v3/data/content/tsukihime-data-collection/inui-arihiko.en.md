Shiki’s partner in crime.
He’s been hanging out with Shiki since elementary school, and had the same antisocial attitude and style of dress even then. His parents died in a disaster when he was young, and he was more-or-less raised by his older sister.
As for why he and Shiki are friends, well, there’s a very good reason for it but it’s a story for another time.
The second Arihiko laid eyes on Shiki, he intuitively knew that he was broken. “I’ve decided, you’re going to be my rival.” So he declared, while eating the pudding he had just stolen from Shiki’s lunch.
By the way, during the initial design phase, Arihiko had a character sprite completely devoid of any sort of “bite.” The scenario director absolutely hated it. So, several days later the art director came back, asked “Fine, then how about this!” and whipped out Arihiko’s current design. The scenario director couldn’t help but burst out laughing. He must have loved it so much his emotions just up and exploded, yeah.
