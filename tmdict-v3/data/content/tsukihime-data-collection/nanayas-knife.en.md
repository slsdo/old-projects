A treasured blade of the Nanaya family, that Makihisa kept for some reason instead of getting rid of it. Of course, even though it’s called a “treasured blade” it isn’t actually valuable, it’s just a sturdily-built knife. Though, mysteriously it has a complex switchblade design despite its considerable age.
It is a high-quality good with the words “Seven Nights” carved into the handle, clearly marking it as property of the Nanaya family.
In *Tsukihime*, Kohaku brought this knife to Shiki saying it was a memento left to him by Makihisa, but in reality she had retrieved it from Makihisa’s room of her own accord.
