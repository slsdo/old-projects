One of the Tohno branch families.
Known as the Bone Masters, they temper their own bones into swords.
Though normally swords are forged from iron, the Touzaki present their own arms upon meeting a worthy recipient, and craft them a sword from the bones.
Their final and greatest work as blacksmiths is a bone sword with qualities that are superficially similar to the legendary mountain destroying sword of mainland China.
