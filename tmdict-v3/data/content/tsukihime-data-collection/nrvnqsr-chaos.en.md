One of the Dead Apostle Ancestors, who was chasing after Arcueid.
The factors of 666 beasts are swirling around within his body, though it may be easier to think of it as him being equipped with 666 familiars.
Because this is essentially like having 666 lives, properly speaking he’s a monster that even a serious Arcueid wouldn’t be able to kill.
Despite his huge, muscular body, he is still a scholar at heart, and becomes extremely agitated when he runs into a situation he cannot understand.
As a result, he lost his cool in his battle against Shiki and ended up recklessly charging at him. Namaste, Nrvnqsr.
Perhaps due to his abilities, he is becoming more and more apathetic and indifferent toward everything. Should he continue to live for another several hundred years, odds are he really will end up degrading into nothing more than a mass of chaos.
His role did not exist in Old Tsukihime. However, in the process of paring the length of the game down to ten days, the art director came forward with the proposal that the first half of the game should be livened up a bit.
“Eh? But I don’t wanna have an enemy besides Roa!”
The scenario director threw a tantrum, but in the end he relented and pulled Nrvnqsr out of the Mushroom Warehouse.
And, presto! Suddenly the flow of the story was just how the art director wanted it.
…Clever bastard.
