One of the 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors. The Knight of Vengeance.
A bloodsucker who only just became an Ancestor, he is known derisively as the “Single-edged Enhance Sword.”
Although normally Dead Apostles only fight within their own group, Enhance is hunting the other members of the 27 Ancestors themselves.
Even though he’s a vampire, he is incomplete, and lacks the superhuman innate abilities possessed by the other Ancestors. On the other hand, his force of will and ability to take action is foremost among the Dead Apostles.
By nature, the immortal Dead Apostles are tranquil beings, but as Enhance is still almost human his vindictiveness knows no bounds.
He fights using the demonic sword Avenger, which he inherited from the Apostle he replaced, and a gun that was manufactured by the Church. Because of its holy origins, the gun corrodes his left arm each time he uses it.
If you’re wondering what an entry like this is doing in this encyclopedia, it’s because he got name-dropped in one of the routes, during a conversation between Arcueid and Ciel.
