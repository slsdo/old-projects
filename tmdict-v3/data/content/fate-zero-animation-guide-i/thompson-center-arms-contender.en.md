The single-shot pistol used by Emiya Kiritsugu. The pistol was developed for competition and hunting purposes. Kiritsugu has customized it with a reforged barrel that applies thaumaturgical processes to the bullet. In addition to the high-power Springfield bullets, it can also fire special Origin Bullets, which are anti-magus bullets. See the entry for Origin Bullet for more information.
