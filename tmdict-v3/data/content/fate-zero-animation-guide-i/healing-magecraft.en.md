Magecraft that can heal wounds. Irisviel uses it to support Saber, but was unable to heal the wound on Saber’s left hand imparted by Lancer’s noble phantasm, Gáe Buidhe. Sola-Ui also uses it to heal Kayneth’s organs after he is wounded by Kiritsugu’s Origin Bullet. However, she is unable to restore his nerves.
