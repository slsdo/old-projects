Surrounded in the north and the south by nature with mountains on one side and ocean on the other, Fuyuki is a city in Japan. The city is divided into east and west by the Mion river. Shinto, the commercial district, lies to the east, and Miyama Town, the older, suburban residential area, is to the west. Fuyuki is the stage of the Holy Grail War. The Three Founding Families chose Fuyuki for the Holy Grail War for its powerful leylines, and as a location in the far-east away from the prying eyes of the Mageâ€™s Association and Holy Church.
