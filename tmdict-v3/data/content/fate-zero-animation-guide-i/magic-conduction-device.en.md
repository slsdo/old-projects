A communication device created by applying the Tohsaka Familyâ€™s Jewel Magic. Similar to a telephone, Tokiomi and Kirei each use on of the devices to communicate at a distance. The device looks like a gramophone, and is embedded with jewels. Resonance of the jewels are utilized to send the voice signal. Of course, they could just use a regular phone for the same purpose, but mages have a tendency to dislike modern technology.
