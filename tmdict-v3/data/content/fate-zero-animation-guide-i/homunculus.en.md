Artificial humanoids created by the Einzbern Family. Fundamentally they are magic circuits that have been shaped into human form, and thus have high aptitude for magecraft. Irisviel and Illyasviel are homunculus, created based on a template of Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern, former head of the Einzbern Family 200 years ago. Because of this they are also embedded with a special feature related to the Holy Grail.
