Magecraft that allows a Master to share their Servant’s perception, and see what the Servant is currently seeing when the Servant is far away. The magical path connection with the contractor enables the sharing of sensory organ perception. Kirei learns this ability during his three years of training under Tokiomi. Tokiomi can also use shared perception, but it requires the consent of the Servant, which he can’t reasonably expect the high and mighty Archer to acquiesce to. Kirei uses shared perception to see through Assassin’s eyes and gain information on Saber and Lancer during their battle at the warehouse area.
