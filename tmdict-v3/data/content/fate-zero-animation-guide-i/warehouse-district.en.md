The location where Saber and Lancer first engage in combat. Despite being very early in the war, the fight ends up bringing in a total of five Servants (six if you include Assassin who was nearby for reconnaissance) causing massive damage to the area. A number of warehouses collapsed due to the battle. I shudder to think how much clean up work the supervisor had to deal with.
