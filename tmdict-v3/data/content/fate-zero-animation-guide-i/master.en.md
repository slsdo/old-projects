Master is a designation given to a magus who has formed a contract with a Servant. Seven Masters are selected at the start of the Holy Grail War (a member from each of the Three Founding Families will always be selected). Masters are bestowed with Command Spells by the Holy Grail, and earn the right to participate in the Holy Grail War. Each Master has a wish, and pursues the Holy Grail as a means to grant that wish, which drives the fierce battles between Masters (there are exceptions such as Uryuu Ryuunosuke).
