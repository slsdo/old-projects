A string of murders committed by Uryuu Ryuunosuke across Fuyuki City. Three bizarre murders were reported in the news prior to the start of the Holy Grail War, and an untold number were committed in cooperation with Caster after the start of the war. Magic circles drawn in the victimâ€™s blood are found at the site of each murder.
