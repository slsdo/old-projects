Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg. One of the five living Magicians. Tohsaka Nagato was once his pupil, and the Tohsaka family took in Zelretchâ€™s teachings. Schweinorg wields the Second Magic, which enables him to move between parallel worlds. He is a complicated and strange man who despises evil and laughs at good deeds.
