A dialogue among Saber, Archer, and Rider regarding who is the most fitting King and therefore most fitting recipient of the Holy Grail. Saber’s concept of kingship is shot down, and having seen Rider’s noble phantasm, she is unable to make a comeback. However, this triggers Archer’s interest in Saber. As an aside, the three kings’ ideals are of equal value, none of them stand above the rest.
