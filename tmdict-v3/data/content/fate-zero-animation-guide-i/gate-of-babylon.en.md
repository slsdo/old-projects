{{n1}}
Archer’s Rank E to Rank A++ anti-unit noble phantasm. Using a key-shaped sword Archer opens a gate to the Golden City, which functions as a vault for his treasures. Archer can freely summon any of his treasures and launch them at the target as a furious storm of projectiles. Archer stores the origin of all the world’s treasures in the vault, giving this Noble Phantasm unrivaled power. In Fate/Zero Archer uses his treasures to instantly eliminate Assassin, who was sneaking into the Tohsaka Residence.
