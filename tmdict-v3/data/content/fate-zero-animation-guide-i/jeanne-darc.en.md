Heroic savior of France in the middle ages, and tragic saint blindly venerated by Caster. Jeanne was a mere shepherdess, but she joined in on the Hundred Years War after receiving a revelation from God. It’s said that she helped free Orléans, which was surrounded by the English army, thereby contributing to France’s victory. However, in the midst of the war, she became caught up in strife between French factions vying for the throne, and during a battle near Compiegne, she was taken prisoner by the English army. After that she was found guilty for heresy and burned at the stake. Catholics believe that the flesh will eventually revive again, so burning at the stake is considered to be one of the most severe punishments. Caster despairs Jeanne’s tragic end and despises God for not saving her from her horrible fate. This spurs Caster to commit atrocities as a means of blasphemy against God.
