Episode 01 begins with Illya being born in Einzbern Castle, Germany. This castle is the home base of the Einzberns. Talk of Irisviel practicing driving on the castle grounds, and the scene depicting Kiritsugu and Illya searching for walnuts around the castle give the viewer a sense of just how large the estate is.
