Special skills or weapons derived from famous events or anecdotal stories involving Heroic Spirits. The name noble phantasm comes from how they arise from the mesh of people’s illusions regarding the event of story. They are activated by infusing magical energy and calling their true name. There is a great variety of noble phantasms possessed by Servants. They can be physical weapons such as swords, spears, and bows. There are also rings, crowns, and other items which provide buffs or supporting abilities. Noble phantasms are categorized based on their effective range/use, such as anti-unit, anti-army, anti-fortress, anti-world, anti-magecraft, and barrier-type. Noble phantasms, being derived from famous events, are closely linked with a Servant’s true name. Therefore they are typically closely held secret during the Holy Grail War. However, in this Fourth Holy Grail War, noble phantasms are released without restraint, despite knowing that enemies are likely looking on from the shadows. Especially Rider is guilty of showing off his big moves.
