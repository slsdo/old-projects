{{n1}}
Excalibur is Saber’s ultimate weapon, the sword said to have been bestowed on King Arthur by the Lady of the Lake. It is a Rank A++ anti-fortress Noble Phantasm. Excalibur is a divine construct forged by the planet as the crystallization of the wishes of mankind for how they want the world to be. Refined and perfected within the planet itself, it is the “Strongest Illusion” (Last Phantasm). Excalibur transforms its wielder’s magical energy into light, emitting an all-destroying beam of converging, accelerating light from the tip of the sword. Its overbearing strength massively affects the surrounding area, which limits how (where) it can be used. It also consumes significant magical energy.
