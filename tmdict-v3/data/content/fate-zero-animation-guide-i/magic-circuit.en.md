Pseudo-nerves within the body of a magus used to perform magecraft. Magic circuits are responsible for converting life force into magical energy. The amount of magic circuits that an individual possesses is determined at birth, but circuits can be passed on from parent to child, so as generations pass and accumulate, a family can create a potent magus. This is also the reason why the Mageâ€™s Association places such emphasis on family lineage.
