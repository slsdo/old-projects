{{n1}}
A blast of wind unleashed by Saber when she dispels the Barrier of the Wind King. She uses this technique to breakthrough the wall of Horrors summoned by Caster in Einzbern Forest. She also uses it when fighting against Lancer in the first battle by positioning her sword behind her and focusing all her mana to explosively propel herself forward. In the 3D fighting game *Fate/unlimited codes* this technique appears as one of Saberâ€™s finishing moves.
