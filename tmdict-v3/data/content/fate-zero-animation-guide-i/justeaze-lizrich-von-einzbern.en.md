Known as the Holy Maiden of Winter. Illustrated in a stained-glass window in Einzbern Castle. Justeaze was the head of the Einzbern family two hundred years ago, and she originally devised the plan for the Holy Grail War system. She is also a homunculus, conceived to fulfill a special function related to the Holy Grail. Irisviel and Illyasviel were created based on Justeaze and can be thought of as successor models of Justeaze.
