The Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament is a special agency charged with the recovery and management of holy artifacts. Kirei and Risei are members. The “Sacrament” in this agency’s name refers to the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church, which according to Catholic theology were entrusted to the Church by God. The “Eight Sacrament” refers to divine grace not derived from Catholic dogma proper. Accordingly, the agency is accustomed to engaging heretical powers beyond the scope of human understanding.
