{{n1}}
Rider’s trump card, a Rank EX anti-army noble phantasm. A reality marble of Rider’s where legendary heroes loyal to him even in death appears after being summoned by the World. It pulls the targets into a barren desert, and crushes them with the massive army. The reason Rider can materialize such a world despite not being a magus is the combined effect of Rider and all these legendary heroes having the same internal landscape. Each member of Rider’s army is equivalent in power to a Servant, and each possesses Rank E- Independent Action skill.
