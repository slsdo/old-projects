The close-combat Chinese martial art mastered by Kotomine Kirei. Bajiquan technique are performed by synergistically using the power of both legs planted on the ground along with rotational motion in the back and shoulders to focus power into the hands and deliver explosive force through the palms by drawing on the strength of the whole body. Accordingly, there is no need to swing punches from the shoulder at a distance, and powerful strikes using the force of the whole body can be performed remaining in close contact with the target. Using the special Bajiquan technique “sunkei,” Kirei was able to split a tree despite both hands being tied.
