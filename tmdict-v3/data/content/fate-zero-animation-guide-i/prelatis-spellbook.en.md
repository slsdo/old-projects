Caster’s Rank A+ anti-army noble phantasm. A spellbook that supplies massive magical energy to its wielder. Can be used to cast High Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals, regardless of its wielder’s capacity for magecraft. Can also be used to summon Horrors [demons] from the depths of the oceans. Made with a cover of human skin, it is said to be a grimoire containing forbidden knowledge of ancient evil gods. The spellbook held by Caster is an Italian translation created by François Prelati. The original is said to have been written in Chinese during the Xia Dynasty.
