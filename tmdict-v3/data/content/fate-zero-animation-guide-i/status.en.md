An easy-to-understand representation of a Servantâ€™s capabilities. Servants are given a rank from A to E in each category (strength, endurance, agility, magic, luck, noble phantasm, and skill). There is also an EX rank which denotes incomparable power outside of standard measurement in that category. Status is based on the tales and legends surrounding a heroic spirit. The more famous a heroic spirit is, or the closer one is to a location relevant to the heroic spirit, the more powerful the heroic spirit will be. Further, the more mana that a Master possesses, the more closely a heroic spirit will be able to exert their full power. Typically a Master can discern the Status of an opponent Servant simply by looking at them, but in some cases, such as Berserker in the Fourth Holy Grail War, a special ability prevents Status from being revealed.
