An organization created to protect those who seek to learn magecraft, regardless of nationality or field of study. Their mission is the management, concealment, and advancement of magecraft. The Association maintains a huge range of research institutions to pursue new heights in magecraft, and also the necessary fighting forces to protect the organization. Comprises three great branches: the Clock Tower in London, the Atlas Institute (“Giant’s Pit”) in Egypt, and the Wandering Sea (“Sea of Estray”) in northern Europe. The Clock Tower currently serves as the headquarters of the Association. In *Fate/Zero*, Tokiomi, Kayneth, Sola-Ui, and Waver are members of the Association.
