Command spells provide a Master with three absolute commands that can be used on their Servant. Command spells are indispensable to ensure the obedience of a Servant. Considered to be a Servantâ€™s shackles. Over the course of a Holy Grail War, command spells can be used up to three times to compel Servants with an undefiable command. Depending on how they are used, command spells can empower a Servant to exceed its normal strength or capabilities. However, after using it for the 3rd time, the command spell will be lost.
