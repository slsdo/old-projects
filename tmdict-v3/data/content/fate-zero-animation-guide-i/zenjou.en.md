Tohsaka Aoiâ€™s family name prior to marrying into the Tohsaka family. Aoi and Rin take shelter at the Zenjou Residence during the Holy Grail War. The Zenjou family today is a normal family with no affinity for magecraft. A few generations prior Zenjou was a practicing magus family, and Zenjou descendants still have magical blood today, which is deserving of special mention. As a result, both Rin and Sakura boast an excellent magus pedigree.
