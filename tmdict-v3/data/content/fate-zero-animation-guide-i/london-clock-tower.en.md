The Clock Tower in London is the headquarters of the Mage’s Association. The institution is devoted to education and research of magecraft. Both Kayneth and Waver come from the Clock Tower. The institution is rife with loud-and-proud discrimination based on family pedigree, which doesn’t make for a particularly healthy atmosphere. Kiritsugu has a spy inside the Clock Tower, monitoring the activities there.
