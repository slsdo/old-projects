The Holy Church is the underground fighting force of a certain “ubiquitous” religion. Kirei and Risei are members. The organization strives to eliminate heresy—that which runs counter to the words of God. It also works to properly manage the Mysteries that exceed conventional human understanding. Naturally, they are on bad terms with the Mage’s Association, which seeks to conceal magecraft, and the two have crossed swords time and time again. At present the two sides have reached a tenuous agreement, and overt hostilities have, at least for now, come to an end. The Holy Church plays the role of a neutral supervisor in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.
