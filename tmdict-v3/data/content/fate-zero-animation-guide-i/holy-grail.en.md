A miraculous wish-granting machine that can grant any wish. The Holy Grail was created 200 years ago by the Three Founding Families. It has its origins as the “wish-granting cauldron” that appears in numerous myths and legends. The Holy Grail that appears in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War is not the original, but rather a replica made to function only as a wish-granting machine.
