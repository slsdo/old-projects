{{n1}}
A class skill bestowed on Assassin class Servants. As the name implies, it enables the Servant to cut off their presence. Ideal for covert operations. Servants with a high rank presence concealment skill can completely cut off their presence, and are thus almost never found out. However, when the Servant postures for attack, the skill rank plummets.
