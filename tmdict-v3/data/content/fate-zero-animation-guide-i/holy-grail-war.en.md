The Holy Grail War is the competition and system employed by Magus who seek the Holy Grail. It takes place about once every 60 years in Fuyuki City, Japan. *Fate/Zero* depicts the Fourth Holy Grail War. The seven Masters selected by the Holy Grail and their seven Servants duke it out in a battle royal until only one pair is left standing. Only the victor can obtain the Holy Grail, which is capable of granting any wish. The Holy Grail War system was created 200 years ago by the Three Founding Families as a massive magecraft ritual to summon the Holy Grail. The First Holy Grail War lacked a proper system and rules, and the ritual ultimately ended in failure. The system was refined over the first three wars, taking place over a span of 200 years, to achieve the current, systematic Holy Grail War system.
