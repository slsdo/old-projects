Each Servant is summoned into a specific class. The seven classes consist of Saber (Knight of the Sword), Archer (Knight of the Bow), Lancer (Knight of the Lance), Rider (Mounted Soldier), Caster (Magus), Berserker (Mad Warrior), and Assassin (Assassin). A heroâ€™s nature and attributes affect the class under which they may be summoned. Servants are typically referred to by their class name, to prevent their True Name from being revealed, which could hint at their weaknesses should an opponent pick up on it.
