The residence of the Tohsaka family, an esteemed magus family which has managed [the leylines in] Fuyuki for generations. Bounded fields are set in the garden as an alarm system. The residence is located on leylines in the area that are second only to those at Mount Enzou, which allowed for the Holy Grail to be summoned here during the Second Holy Grail War.
