{{n1}}
The hallowed scabbard of Excalibur. Rank EX Noble Phantasm. The name “Avalon” comes from the land of the fairies in the legend of King Arthur. The Everdistant Utopia (Avalon) heals its bearer and prevents aging when infused with magical energy. When employed as a Noble Phantasm, it shields its wielder in the land of the fairies, bestowing absolute defense which nothing may interfere with. This feat is in the realm of true magic. The 1500 year-old scabbard was dug up in Cornwall at the behest of the Einzbern family. Emiya Kiritsugu uses it to summon Saber.
