Lancer’s skill “Love Spot.” Rank C. His beauty spot [on his cheek] is imbued with magic that charms women. The effect can be avoided with magic resistance. In the story, Saber and Irisviel successfully resist the skill. Sola-Ui appears to be charmed by Lancer, but it’s unclear whether this is due to the skill or due to natural attraction to Lancer as a person.
