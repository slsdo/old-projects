{{n1}}
Kaynethâ€™s mystic code made of mercury. It can shift shapes to suit any purpose; attacking, defending, scouting, etc. The mercury is filled with magical energy and is preprogrammed with multiple shapes. It automatically changes shape to optimally handle the situation, but this can also be a weakness if the enemy identifies a pattern in its function. The more complicated the shape it takes, the more magical energy is required to sustain it.
