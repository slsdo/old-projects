Kiritsugu’s self-taught time-manipulation magecraft in which he creates a reality marble inside his body in order to manipulate time inside his body. It is Kiritsugu’s personal method of utilizing the Emiya family’s magecraft. He adapted the technique to make it suitable for combat. Time manipulation is typically a large scale thaumaturgical ritual, but by limiting the effects to within his own body, he can use it efficiently in small intervals. By accelerating or decelerating time within his body, he can perform actions otherwise impossible, however it takes a severe toll on his body.
