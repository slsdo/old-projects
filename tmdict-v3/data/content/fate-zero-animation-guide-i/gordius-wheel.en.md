{{n1}}
A war chariot pulled by a pair of divine bulls who trample the enemy with hoof, wheel, and lightning. Rider’s Rank A+ anti-army noble phantasm. It can shape-shift into the ideal form to traverse any terrain with maximum efficiency. It isn’t limited to moving along the ground and can also fly in the sky. Iskander is said to have cut the knot binding an ox cart tied up at the shrine by Gordias, King of Phrygia. This event is the origin of the saying “cutting the Gordian Knot.”
