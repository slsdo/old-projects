Heroic spirits are individuals enshrined or worshipped in legends after their death in the mortal world. What can be thought of as a heroic spirit’s “main body” resides in the Throne of Heroes, and can only be summoned by the World. A Servant is merely an “emanation” or pseudo-copy of a heroic spirit’s main body, summoned by ritual. Magus selected as Masters are only capable of summoning a Servant with the aid of the Holy Grail. A Servant is a Master’s sword and shield. They are the primary tool of combat in the Holy Grail War. Magus aren’t typically cut out for physical fighting, making Servants essential to engage in combat with other Servants. The Holy Grail gives those summoned as Servants the minimum information required to allow them to fit into the current era. This enables Servants from ages long past to operate in modern society without issue.
