Magi [singular: Magus] are practitioners of techniques for the artificial reenactment of Mysteries and Miracles, known as magecraft. Magi are born with a nerve-like system, called magic circuit throughout their body, which is employed to convert life force into magical energy in order to wield magecraft. To be more specific, magecraft is the ability to reenact Mysteries and Miracles that could be replicated by human civilization of the era. On the other hand, Magic is the ability to enact Mysteries and Miracles that are impossible for human civilization to ever achieve through any method or means. In the present era, where almost anything is possible through science and human cooperation, most magecraft has ceased to be Magic, and supposedly a mere five Magic remain today.
