{{n1}}
Class skill bestowed on the Archer class. Normally, a Servant that loses their Master, and therefore their supply of magical energy, will disappear from the real world within a few hours. However, even if they lose their Master, a Servant with this skill is able to act independently in the real world for several days (depending on the rank of the skill).
