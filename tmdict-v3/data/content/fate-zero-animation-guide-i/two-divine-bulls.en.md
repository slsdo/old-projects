Refers to the “God Bulls,” the two bulls that pull the Gordius Wheel chariot. In Greek mythology, Zeus, the master of lightning, transforms into a white bull in order to seduce Europa, princess of Tyre. Gordius Wheel is a chariot said to have been given as an offering to Zeus, so the divine bulls appear as part of the noble phantasm reflecting this background.
