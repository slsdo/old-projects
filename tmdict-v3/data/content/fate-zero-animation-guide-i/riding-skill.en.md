A class skill bestowed on Rider and Saber class Servants. It enables the Servant to effectively ride or use all manner of beasts and vehicles, although this depends on the skill rank. A high rank even enables the Servants to tame and ride phantasmal beasts and divine beasts. Saber can drive thanks to this skill.
