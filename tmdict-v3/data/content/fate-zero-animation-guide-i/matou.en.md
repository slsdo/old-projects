One of the Three Founding Families. The Matou family devised the Servant system employed in the Holy Grail War. The family specializes in creating familiars, which contributed to the creation of the system of binding Servants with Command Spells. 200 years ago, Makiri Zolgen, with the dream of eliminating all evil in the world, moved the family from Europe to Japan. He changed the family name Makiri to Matou, and his own name from Zolgen to Zouken to emulate a more Japanese-style name. The family’s blood lineage has become diluted over the years, which spells ruin for a magus family. Perhaps Japan’s land wasn’t a good match for the family.
