One of the Three Founding Families that established the Holy Grail system employed in Holy Grail Wars. A distinguished magus family, although the family possesses great knowledge of alchemy, it is somewhat lacking in combat capabilities. This led to the family taking in Emiya Kiritsugu, who excels on the battlefield. The Einzbern’s have zealously sought the Third Magic “Heaven’s Feel (Cup of Heaven)” in their efforts to replicate this miracle that their ancestors once attained.
