{{n1}}
Lancer’s longer spear. “Dearg” means red. Rank B anti-unit noble phantasm. In life, it was given to Lancer as a gift from his foster father, the druid Aengus Óg. The spear severs the ties to magical energy of any object it touches. Accordingly, since it can basically only be defended against by physical means, it is known as a “noble phantasm breaker.” Lancer usually keeps it wrapped in talisman cloth.
