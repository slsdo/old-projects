{{n1}}
A barrier of wind that covers Excalibur. Rank C anti-unit noble phantasm. The many layers of wind bend light, rendering the sword invisible. This gives an advantage during battle where the opponent cannot easily tell how long the weapon is. However, Lancer’s noble phantasm Gáe Dearg temporarily disrupts the effect, and he is able to grasp the length of the sword.
