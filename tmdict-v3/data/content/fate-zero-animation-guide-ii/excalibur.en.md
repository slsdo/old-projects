{{n1}}
A Rank A++ Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm that emits an all-destroying beam of energy rivaling Saber’s total magical energy. Being sung as “humanity’s most revered” even in the hellish extremes of a battlefield, shining brightly as the crystallization of everything imaginable in the hearts of those who have passed. Because its use requires swinging with both hands, Lancer intentially breaks his Gáe Buidhe to release Saber’s left hand from its curse. The resulting blow from Excalibur that was released is a torrent of light that destroys the giant sea demon.
