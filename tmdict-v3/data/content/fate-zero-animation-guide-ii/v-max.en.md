A motorcycle that Kiritsugu procures for Saber, designed to maximize the effectiveness of her riding skill. Designed to be driven by a Servant, the bike is a monster machine that surpasses all reason. The bikeâ€™s base is a Yamaha V-MAX, but the engine has been upgraded to a larger bore four-cylinder 1400 cc unit, and the drive train has been enhanced from end-to-end. It boasts 250 horsepower. The engine also sports a special V-boost structure which enables explosive acceleration. It easily breaks 300 km/h. The bike also has a nitrous oxide boost button under the thumb location of the right handle which increases output by 50% for extreme acceleration.
