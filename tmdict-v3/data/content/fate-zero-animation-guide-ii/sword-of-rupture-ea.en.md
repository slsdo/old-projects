Gilgamesh’s secret treasure and final resort. A sword he only draws against those he has deemed worthy. Ea is said to be the sword used to “split open the world ” during the creation of heaven and earth. Its maximum power is equal to or greater than that of Saber’s Excalibur. Gilgamesh claims to possess the origin of all noble phantasms, but unlike his other noble phantasms that were passed on to other heroes throughout history, Ea, Sword of Rupture is a sword only Gilgamesh possesses, a unique existence that can only be possessed by him. For that reason, even Unlimited Blade Works (Infinite Creation of Swords) cannot recreate it. The origin comes from Mesopotamian mythology about the Great God of Earth and Water, Ea, who was split between heaven and earth. The reason the sword has a drill-like appearance is that apparently drills used to bore tunnels in the bedrock of the ocean floor were used as a model.
