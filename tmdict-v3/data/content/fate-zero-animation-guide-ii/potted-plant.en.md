One of Norikata’s thaumaturgical accomplishments. The flow of time of the potted plants is manipulated such that the plants never grow (age) and thus never wilt. This technique employs a reality marble that does not receive any interference from the world. It is based on Emiya family’s magecraft for slowing and accelerating time.
