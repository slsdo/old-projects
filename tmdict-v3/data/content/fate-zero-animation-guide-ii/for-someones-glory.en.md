{{n1}}
A Rank B anti-unit noble phantasm that enables one’s own Status and appearance to be concealed. The power is derived from an anecdotal tale in which Berserker disguises himself to successfully vanquish the enemy. The skill normally allows a Servant to take on any appearance, but Berserker is unable to manifest this power due to having lost all reason. Kariya uses a command spell to enable Berserker to disguise himself as Rider just once.
