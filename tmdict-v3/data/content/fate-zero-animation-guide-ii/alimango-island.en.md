A small fishing village in the south of about 30 households. Wild jungle sprawls behind the village. “Alimago” means crab. The name comes from a tale that a young girl stole a crab that was an offering to the god of the sea, angering them, and was transformed into a Japanese freshwater crab. The village is Emiya Norikata’s last refuge in his life on the run since being targeted with a sealing designation. Almost everyone in the village is killed after the appearance of Dead Apostles and the subsequent cover up effort by the Holy Church and Mage’s Association.
