{{n1}}
Excalibur’s sheath. It prevents aging and provides unlimited healing and restoration. Rank EX barrier-type noble phantasm. Irisviel uses the power of the sheath to stave off the collapse of the “shell” that is her herself. The sheath is eventually passed to Kiritsugu to mitigate the damages that Innate Time Control causes to the inside of his body, as well as instantly restores Kiritsugu after he takes a blow from Kirei that would otherwise spell instant death. Kiritsugu later embeds the sheath in Shirou, saving his life. He adopts Shirou after this event. The connection of the sheath also contributes to Shirou being able to summon Saber in the Fifth Holy Grail War.
