{{n1}}
Anti-world noble phantasm that destroys everything. This noble phantasm is the maximum power state of Ea, Sword of Rupture. Dislocations of compressed intertwined layers of wind pressure create a pseudo time-space dislocation to cut through space. This unbelievable power cuts the World itself, completely pulverizing all enemies. It can only be offset by a simultaneous blow delivering an equivalent level of damage. Using this attack in combination with launching other noble phantasms from the treasury further increases its lethality.
