A short sword given to Kirei by Tokiomi. It is a symbol that Kirei has completed his study of the Tohsaka Familyâ€™s magecraft. This sword is used to murder Tokiomi, and later Kirei gives it to Rin, who is unaware of this fact. As a twist of fate, ten years later in the Fifth Holy Grail War, this sword is used to deliver a fatal wound to Kirei. The weapon is not designed to be used as a cutting implement, it is to supplement and boost magecraft similar to a magic staff. The original is said to have been a sword loved by Swiss alchemist Paracelsus in the late middle ages.
