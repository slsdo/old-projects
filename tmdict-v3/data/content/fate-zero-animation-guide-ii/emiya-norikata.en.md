The fourth generation head of the Emiya Family. With the goal of pursuing the Root, he conducts research into transforming into a Dead Apostle in his atelier in a small bungalo on Alimago Island. Iniside his body, he has inherited the family magecraft of manipulating time, that is, to affect small scale causality. His progress in his research was so great that the Mage’s Association targeted him with a sealing designation. He has an eccentric and strict personality, and deeply loves his son Kiritsugu. He has been on the run for over 20 years since being targeted with the sealing designation. His wife was killed by the Mage’s Association while they were on the run.
