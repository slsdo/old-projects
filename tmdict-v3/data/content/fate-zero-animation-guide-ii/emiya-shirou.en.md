Shirou is one of the few survivors of the Fuyuki Great Fire. He was narrowly saved by Kiritsugu. After losing everything in the Fourth Holy Grail War, Shirou’s existence becomes Kiritsugu’s last hope. Shirou lost his relatives in the fire, so Kiritsugu takes him in as his adopted son. They move in and restore the Japanese manor in Miyama Town that was formerly used as Irisviel’s secret hideout. They spend five years together in this house before Kiritsugu breathed his last. Shirou calls Kiritsugu “old man” despite him not even being 40 yet. Shirou absolutely adores Kiritsugu. Shirou is influenced by Kiritsugu, and comes to possess what can be only called an excessive sense of self-sacrifice and justice. Kiritsugu’s only regret is how Shirou took after him in this way. Shirou admires Kiritsugu and inherits the ideal of becoming a Hero of Justice. He follows that path to the stone, which becomes especially apparent after the breakout of the Fifth Holy Grail War.
