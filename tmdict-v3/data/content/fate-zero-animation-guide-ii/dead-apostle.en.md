Vampires that possess a nearly immortal body. They were formerly human, but they transformed after having their blood sucked by a True Ancestor or another dead apostle. A dead apostle’s body is constantly decaying. Sucking human blood prevents this. Shirley becoming a dead apostle on Alimago Island is quite irregular because it is the result of Norikata’s research. However, after her transformation into a Dead Apostle, she is unable to restraint her desire to suck blood, so Norikata deems it a failure.
