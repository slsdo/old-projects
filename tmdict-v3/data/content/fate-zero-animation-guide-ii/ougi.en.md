F15J pilot. Pilots the Diablo 1 unit. Rank is captain. Headed to the Mion river alongside Kobayashi to scout. He fell into confusion after his wingman is eaten by the monster before his eyes. While removing the safety on all weapons and preparing to launch a massive attack on the monster, Berserker hijacks the F15 with his noble phantasm. In the fight with Vimana, Ougi is subjected to insane G-forces which causes his organs to burst leading to his death. In the Type-Moon 10th Anniversary All-Character Poll, he ranked 110th of 500 characters, trailing Kobayashi by a bit.
