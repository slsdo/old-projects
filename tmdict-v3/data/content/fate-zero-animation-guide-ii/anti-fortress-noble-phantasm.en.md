A noble phantasm that is powerful enough to blow away even a sturdy castle. Significantly higher power than anti-unit and anti-army noble phantasms, but it consumes a massive amount of mana and is difficult to use in quick succession. Saberâ€™s Sword of Promised Victory (Excalibur) belongs to this category.
