{{n1}}
Kariya’s most deadly and atrocious method of attack consisting of bugs given to him by Zouken. Bugs the size of fat rats shed their skin and transform into winged beetle-like creatures with shiny black armor. These carnivorous insects are ferocious and their teeth are sharp enough to cut through a bull’s bones. A large flock attack Tokiomi simultaneously, but they are no match for his flame and are burned to a crisp.
