Berserker is only able to use it after sealing his other two noble phantasms. While this sword is drawn, it boosts the wielder’s parameters. There are ancedotal tales of the sword being used to fight dragons, and as such the noble phantasm deals extra damage to heroic spirits with a dragon attribute. The sword was originally only allowed to be wielded by the greatest knight of its time [Lancelot]. However, after being used to slay the kins of his compatriots, it was tainted and became a demonic sword.
