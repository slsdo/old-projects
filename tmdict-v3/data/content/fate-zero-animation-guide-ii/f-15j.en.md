Fighter jet of the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) deployed at the front line. Developed by Boeing in the U.S., which licensed manufacturing to the ASDF. After an disaster emergency summon by the Fuyuki police, a pair of F15J cut short their patrol and headed toward the Mion river. Kobayashi’s unit is eaten by the Giant Sea Monster, and Ougi’s unit is taken over by Berserker’s noble phantasm, and engages in a spectacular dog fight with Vimana. Risei arranged for a middle east weapons dealer to supply two new F15 to cover up the loss of the units by the ASDF.
