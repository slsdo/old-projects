{{n1}}
A Rank A++ anti-unit noble phantasm that imparts the user’s properties to any weapon or armament that is touched to create Rank D noble phantasms. If the original weapon is higher than Rank D, it maintains its higher rank and comes under Berserker’s control. This ability comes from the tale that in life, Berserker was forced into a fight without a weapon, and picked up an elm branch to fight.
