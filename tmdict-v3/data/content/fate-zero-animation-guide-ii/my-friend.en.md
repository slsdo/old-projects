{{n1}}
Refers to Gilgamesh the King of Heroes’ one and only companion, Enkidu. Enkidu was originally an existence created by the gods to defeat Gilgamesh, but Enkidu and Gilgamesh were evenly matched in battle, and came to recognize each other and become friends. Enkidu has a gender-neutral appearance and mild personality. Enkidu makes an appearance in the spin off *Fate/strange fake*, as the Servant Lancer in the battle for the False Holy Grail.
