The ceasefire proposed by Irisviel in response to Tokiomi’s suggestion that they unite against a common enemy. Only after defeating the other Masters would Tohsaka be considered a foe. As a condition for the agreement, Irisviel demands the “disclosure of all information on Rider and his Master,” and “the elimination of Kotomine Kirei from the Holy Grail War.”
