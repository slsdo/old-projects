The dying message left behind by Risei. Written in blood. Refers to John 4:24. Kirei recites the Holy Words of the passage to revive the leftover command spells and transfer them from Risei to himself. This marks the the beginning of Kirei’s role as supervisor of the Holy Grail War. The Holy Words are “God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”
