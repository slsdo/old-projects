A black rifle that the Gun God uses. Created by a mineral that counters all Gin, it’s a weapon that is feared by life forms that carry any slight amount of Gin.
But because all living beings that exists in the world are affected by Gin, it is impossible for them use or even touch it.
The God killer gun. If the target creature is stronger… in other words, the more Gin it carries, the more powerful the bullet becomes.
…Today, only the rare species that weren’t able to evolve and doesn’t carry any Gins can touch this gun.
