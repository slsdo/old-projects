A planet that died. A globe that reached its end. A world where living things can’t live.
The name of the world in the present time. It’s not its official name, but a nick name passed down between the people who live in the corrupted land. Like the name Land of Steel indicates, a large part of the continent are now wild lands that are torn apart, covered by a tainted gray colored cloud.
Food can’t be grown, and the atmosphere is no longer suited for the animals.
To put it in a human species way, a drastic end of a century. But even after the mother planet died, the humans were able to live on with its developed civil technology.
Even the planet’s end where people once imagined, couldn’t bring an end to mankind.
