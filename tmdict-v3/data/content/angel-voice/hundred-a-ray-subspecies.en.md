Next generation primates that were created by the human species who used up all the planetâ€™s resource.
They were modeled after the living things that used to exist on the planet. They were modified/enhanced in order for them to survive on the corrupted planet. There were numerous branches to the A-rays, and they were categorized into about 100 major species. From 1 to 10 consists of only one type of A-rays each and not a mass.
Some carry the genes of humans and they look like us, but a large part of them are mix/evolved form of various creatures and primates.
