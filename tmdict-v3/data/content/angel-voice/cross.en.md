A cross shaped Aristoteles that is 3000 meters long.
It’s outer shell is composed of an illuminating mineral, and there’s nothing else. This flying object fires a rain of light to the ground from its body.
The rain is a cross shaped electric impact that is a meter long, and it explodes as it hits the ground, annihilating the living things around it. There are variations to this cross shaped light and some causes an earthquake that tears apart the earth as it lands on the ground. The crosses struck on the ground are just like tombs spread about on the wild land.
Also known as the Flying Fortress, it seems to be the leader of the Aristoteles’s that are on the planet.
