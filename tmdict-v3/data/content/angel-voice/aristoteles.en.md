8 Life forms that appeared near the end of the war. Unknown existences.
Not only their appearance, but each of their biology differs significantly.
The reason they used this name is a mystery, but the origin is probably a scientist from the old age. 
Considering mankind and A-ray as their enemies, they repetitively attacked them indiscriminately. Mankind were broken their platform completely, and the hundred A-rays decreased in number significantly by them. 
After the Great War was over, they slowed down their activity by the sea of clouds that covered the sky, but they still continue to slaughter the living things on the planet.
Since then, the human species and the A-rays ceased fire, and till they destroy the common enemy, they grouped themselves together as the human race.
