An Aristoteles estimated to be a thousand meters long. It appeared after the Great War and was flying in the sea of clouds. Its shape was never confirmed by anyone, and its details was unknown.
A life form that had a pair of wings, and compared to the other Aristoteles’s, it was close to this planet’s species.
According to the records, it was shot down in the mission by the Knights in the 83rd year of the new calendar, and it fell somewhere on the continent. Originally, it was a life form that lands on the earth of a planet, rooting itself, and spreading its spore as it eats away the planet. It can also be described a gigantic carnivorous plant.
……It was put to an eternal sleep by the Black Barrel.
