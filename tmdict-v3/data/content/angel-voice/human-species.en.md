Human race on the Land of Steel. Evolved form of the old human beings who adapted to this world without changing their shape. They technically belong to the A-rays as well.
They were able to adapt and live on today’s environment, but they still don’t carry any ability more than a normal human being.
They are building a country in order to reconstruct their old civilization. Cease-fire with the Hundred A-rays.
