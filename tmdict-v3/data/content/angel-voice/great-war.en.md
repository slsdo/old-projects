After the death of the planet, there was a war between the survived human race and the Hundred A-rays.
Mankind in order to survive, and the A-rays to rule the world.
Under the Six-Sisters who united the unmassed A-rays, the human race were on the verge of defeat. Near the end of the war, mankind created the Knights and the Human Species, and it further killed the planet thatâ€™s already dead.
There was no victor to this war. It was interrupted by an intruder that suddenly appeared and nearly wiped out both sides.
