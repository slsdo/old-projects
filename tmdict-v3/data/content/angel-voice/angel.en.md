Artificial angels within the Hundred A-rays. The 20th species within the 100, but it is equal to the top 10 just considering its power to destroy objects. A mass that protects a single A-ray species. The original is an angel in the largest religion of the old age. A human type that has a pair of bird wings.
Aggressive species that uses the absorbed heavy particle that scattered in the atmosphere after the world got destroyed as its source of power.
