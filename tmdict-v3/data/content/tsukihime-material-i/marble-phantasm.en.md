Fantasy Manifestation{{n1}}.
An ability that the Elementals who are the sense of touch of the planet have, and which enables the reconstruction of the world through probability fluctuations. By directly connecting their own will to the world, they transfigure the world to an environment just as they picture it.
However, it can’t directly interfere with individuals who have become independent from the world such as humans or animals. Fantasy Manifestation is simply something to freely alter the surroundings and circumstances.
Furthermore, the Millennium Castle having suddenly manifested in Souya in Ciel’s route, is nothing else than that castle being created by the will of the True Ancestor who is its owner (Arcueid).
