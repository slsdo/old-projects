Talented vampires acknowledged by an Ancestor as their heir. Princes and princesses so to speak. There are also some Ancestors who become fascinated at first sight with someone who is not a vampire, and they are abruptly promoted to this rank.
Assuming there are at the very least two VIII ranks for each Ancestor, there are at least fifty or more Successors. It is said there are Successors created to imitate True Ancestors.
Vampires of these level are powerful, and just in terms of basic reserves, they are even better than Vlov, who made his way into the ranks of the Twenty-Seven Apostles.
