A holy relic that can never be taken off its premises, made for the Holy Church to represent the authority of the Lord, and whose user was absent for a long time.
The embodiment of an artificially made miracle.
A Conceptual Weapon that was put together as a scripture a thousand years ago, by luring one of the scarce Phantasmal Species that remained on this world, and forging divine steel by burning it along with the maiden who acted as the catalyst in a furnace.
Every single primary factor of death humans are burdened with, including the crushing of the soul ——— for instance beheading, is recorded, and the divine steel continues chanting a baptism of admonishment with characteristic vibrations.
The conjoined form of the six armaments: dual guns, bayonet, greatsword, armor, and the core, founded on the horn of a unicorn, is operated as an Anti-Vampire Mobile Armament, and through further deployment it can be transformed into a siege ballista.
