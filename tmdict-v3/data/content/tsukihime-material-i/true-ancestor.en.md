The vampires of the beginning.
One of the races of fairy called Elementals which were made independent as the planet’s own sense of touch.
They are a completely different species from the Dead Apostles who were formerly humans, and beings close to limitless immortality, not affected by any religious rite of purification, nor by sunlight.
Receiving back-up from the planet the limits of their activity could be said to be the limits of the natural world itself, and if one thought of the Earth as an individual life form they would be something like leukocytes, equivalent to the main cause of the extermination of humans who prey on nature.
Just as humans perceive the vampires who prey upon themselves as “evil,” for the True Ancestors, the humans who plunder resources while receiving the favor of the planet are “evil”…… That’s how things are.
