An ability of the True Ancestors who are the planet’s sense of touch. They store everything that was brought up on the surface of the planet, both conceptually and physically. A storage of every creative work on the planet’s surface ——— A confiscation of “Texture.”
It is an unusual ability that would be on the level of “Authorities” if one was to speak about Divine Spirits, but it is a function possessed by the planet so rather than a Skill it is a System. The sphere of gravity that appeared under Arc’s feet after she became a Luminous Body has a scale enough to store the Textures of the whole Earth.
