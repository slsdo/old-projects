Dead that despite having will, are incapable of precise thinking, and that mimic their appearance from their previous life. Although they will not decompose due to the mana of their owner, their insides have decayed completely.
While they seek flesh and blood by mere instinct since their brains are rotten, they are more ferocious than the I rank Dead. Falls in the category of those that are called “The Dead.”
