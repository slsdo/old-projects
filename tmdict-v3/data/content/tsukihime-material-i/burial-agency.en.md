A secret department of the “Holy Church,” a major religious organization in Europe. Assigned the inconspicuous name Burial Agency.
It consists of seven combat agents, called Executors, who have been assigned the duty of “executing the teachings of the Lord by the hands of humans.”
An extraterritoriality within the Holy Church, in exchange for not vying for power within the organization, Executors are not fettered by the Holy Church’s authority. A moving ordnance department. An enforcement squad with a small number of agents. They are in charge of the extermination of the “inhuman beings” recognized by the Church as heretics who can never come out in public ——— vampires.
Ciel is the seventh Executor of the Burial Agency, and has the title of “Bow.”
