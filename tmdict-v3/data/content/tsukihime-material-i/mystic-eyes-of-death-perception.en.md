The supernatural power that manifested in Tohno Shiki as an after-effect of the incident from seven years ago. Mystic Eyes that can grasp the concept of “time of death” naturally embedded within all of creation ——— “lines where things can die easily.”
One of the “phenomena that cannot be achieved under any circumstance” in opposition to the “physical phenomena that can be achieved by modern technology.” By tracing the “lines of death” it is possible to sever the target and impart death (this is not killing by severing the target, but rather the target being severed as a result of killing it).
With the “Mystic Eye Killers” glasses received from his mentor (Aozaki Aoko) in the past he can suppress his power to a level where does not impede daily life, but when Shiki finds himself in an extreme situation the glasses cannot suppress the power of his eyes from welling up.
Ultimately it is possible to trace the “lines” or “dots” of not only living things but also non-living things, and even perceive the death of any kind of space or existence.
