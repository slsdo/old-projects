Twenty-seven individuals who have become the apex of Dead Apostles.
A title that represents their way of existing.
There are exceptions like the “League of the Age of Gods” formed by five veterans, but each of them have a fundamentally hostile relation, and also, not all of them are enemies of humans.
Vacancies amongst the 27 has arisen over the three-thousand-year history of vampires, and excluding the six principles of Offenbaum’s principle, who was Vlov’s progenitor, the principle of “Harvest,” the principle of “Castle, therefore Kingdom,” the principle of “Sword,” and the principle of “Melting” who is sealed at the Church, along with the principle of “Four Limbs,” there are currently twenty-one confirmed remaining Apostles.
In order for the Church to seal an Ancestor, preparations are carried out for a hundred years, but it is said that there have only been two instances that they have succeeded. Taking these precedents into accounts, it is clear how irregular Vlov’s subjugation by Tohno Shiki is.
