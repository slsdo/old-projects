A Lancer-class Servant, and front-liner in Tamamo’s army.
Karna is a hero who appears in the ancient Indian epic, the *Mahabharata*.
The child of the Sun God Surya, he is a tragic hero who was never able to bask in the glory of his divine lineage due to a variety of misfortunes throughout his life.
Although he endured a great deal of hardship, Karna himself has no regrets.
In fact, he believes that because he received superhuman abilities from his father, it is his duty to suffer through trials and tribulations.
Karna is also known as the “Hero of Charity” and is famous for his noble nature, that of someone who basically never refuses any sort of request.
He is a Top Servant who was summoned by the Moon Cell.
Tamamo was the first one to invite him to join her army after he was summoned to SE.RA.PH, which led to him siding with the Millennium Capital.
His sharp appearance, combined with the austerity of his words and actions, cause many to incorrectly believe that he is unapproachable and fearsome. In reality, he is one of the most decent people amongst all the Servants.
