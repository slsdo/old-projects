Artificial virtual organisms created in order to run the Holy Grail Wars smoothly.
NPCs are programmed with specific roles, and can not deviate from their designation, however, the Moon Cell assigned each NPC its own individual personality and thoughts.
The Moon Cell calculated the need to create and use them, while also observing that the Masters would need to be able to interact with them on a genuine human level.
However, their “personas” were meant to be disposable, and it was impossible for them to escape the world view that was programmed into them.
Once each Holy Grail War ended, the Moon Cell would confiscate the NPCs’ accumulated experiences and memories. Everything about them, including their bodies, stats, and personalities, would be reset, and they would be recycled as “tools” to facilitate the next Holy Grail War.
Such was their lot for many years, but now that the world has been reborn as the new SE.RA.PH, the Moon Cell granted each of them the right to continue living as they are. Although they still have roles to play, their faces are definitely brighter now, considering there’s no longer a giant reset button about to be pushed that terminates them once the battle of the Masters comes to an end.
Some NPCs desire to become true Al by embracing their humanity. They are driven to improve themselves. The sudden influx of new NPC businesses in New Rome and the Millennium Capital is not due to a widespread awakening to the spirit of capitalism; rather, the NPCs are gathering resources in order to make their dreams come true.
And yet Tamamo, ever the evil dictator, mercilessly taxes their hard-earned wages.
