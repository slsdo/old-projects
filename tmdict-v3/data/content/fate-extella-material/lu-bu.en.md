A Berserker-class Servant in Tamamo no Mae’s army.
Lu Bu Fengxian was a traitorous general who appeared in the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* and was known by many names, including “Unequaled on Heaven and Earth,” the “Flying General,” and “The Beast Among Men.”
Known as one of the supreme warlords in the world of the Three Kingdoms, he was a “war god who would serve no man,” and repeatedly betrayed his allies.
Expecting to be turned down when she invited him to join her army, Tamamo was pleasantly surprised when he readily agreed. Tamamo has unknowingly invited an enemy into her midst, as Lu Bu aims to take her head.
