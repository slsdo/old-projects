A Saber-class Servant in Nero’s army.
Gawain appears in the legends of King Arthur as an illustrious knight, rivaled only by “Lancelot of the Lake.” The eldest child of King Lot, the ruler of Orkney and Lothian, he is also the nephew of King Arthur, which is why he was occasionally entrusted with the Divine Sword Excalibur. He is known as a virtuous man, and his valor in battle is noted in many stories.
He fought the Main Character as the Servant of Leonardo B. Harwey in *Fate/EXTRA*.
His belief that he should serve under a King has not changed, and he has chosen to work for Nero since she possesses the Royal Authority. 
Despite the fact that he assists her, he has not pledged his loyalty to her. He trusts the Main Character, who helped him to grow further by defeating Leo. 
The discovery that Tamamo also has a Regalia shook him, but he was able to assuage his misgivings by thinking, “I can trust Saber more than I can trust that Caster. In the end, I made the right decision.”
Such is Gawain’s nature. He wields his sword with renewed enthusiasm after he finds out that the Main Character was the one who was chosen by the Regalia.
His side story has him facing off with a mysterious intruder, the blue-clad Saber. Sometimes he deserves to show off his cool side!
