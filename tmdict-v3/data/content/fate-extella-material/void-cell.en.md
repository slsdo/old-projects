A Void Cell is a spiritron-gathering entity. Although it is of the same standing as the Moon Cell, its existence appears to be of a different nature.
This particular Void Cell dwells at the core of Alteraâ€™s Ark of the Stars.
The moment Archimedes came in contact with the Ark, he was contaminated by the Void Cell, and it was subsequently passed on to Elizabeth as well.
