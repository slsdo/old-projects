Wizards are the A-Rank hackers in the *Fate/EX* series. Compared to other hackers, they possess an unusually high level of talent and gift, and can send their very souls into SE.RA.PH.
They transform their souls, minds, and bodies not into digital information, but into spiritrons. With their engineering skills, they can then use these avatars to navigate cyberspace.
In other words, they are able to fashion “physical” shells, called Cyber Frames, within the digital world. Cyber Frames being the combined spiritron embodiment of body, mind, and spirit in SE.RA.PH.
While knowledge and skill are both obviously important to hackers, what’s most important is talent of both mind and body.
To be a true hacker, one must have the rare ability to clearly imagine the nature of one’s body virtually as a sequence of numbers, utilizing a set of “virtual nerves” known as “magical circuits.”

Sentient beings within the digital world, whether they have truly physical bodies are not, can still be considered “alive,” in that they can affect change in their environments according to their own will and conditions.
The Moon Cell recognizes beings with this ability, and allows them to explore its virtual space, pioneering new frontiers — as has been mankind’s greatest purpose, and greatest sin.
For Wizards who have access to these possibilities, one could even say that cyberspace is a second reality to them. A Wizard’s original body, back on Earth, is merely its “house.” Even if one’s body on Earth should perish, they will be only be unable to return to that house, and nothing more. They can remain in the new frontier of cyberspace, and as long as they are not extinguished there, their soul will continue to exist.
(However, Wizards who do lose their physical bodies also lose those bodies’ natural resistance to change. While they can continue to exist, their thought processes and value structures easily bend and warp, and a change of nature becomes as unavoidable.)
For a Wizard, “death” is the death of his or her digital brain. The moment his or her soul burns out in the cyber world, they irreversibly turn to dust.
The Main Character is a Wizard who now lacks a body on Earth, due to past events explained in a previous game, *Fate/EXTRA*.
