The title held by those who previously participated in the Holy Grail Wars.
For the most part, they are Wizards (or, in the days of magic in the physical world, Mages), but sometimes normal people who happen to have magical circuits are registered as Masters
as well.
They form contracts with Servants who will fight on their behalf, and command them in battle. When the new SE.RA.PH was created, the only remaining Master who was present there was the Main Character, but following the ending of EXTELLA, many Masters should begin to appear as new inhabitants.
