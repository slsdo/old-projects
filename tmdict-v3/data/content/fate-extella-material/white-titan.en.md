The Anti-Cell who crashed on the moon after being purged by the Umbral Star.
A giant, godlike being who laid waste to the civilizations of Earth during the Paleolithic era, which was also the dawn of the era of the Gods. She is also responsible for damaging the Moon Cell 14,000 years ago.
She fought viciously within the Moon Cell as an Anti-Cell, and on the Earthâ€™s surface as an organic life form.
Her goal is to ravage the entirety of civilization on Earth and in Moon Cell, leaving not a trace behind, but she failed to accomplish this in both cases when she was literally one step away.
Her main body was shut down by the firewall of the Moon Cell and sequestered in the Zero Dark, and her alter ego on the surface of the Earth was defeated by a divine sword and returned to the soil.
