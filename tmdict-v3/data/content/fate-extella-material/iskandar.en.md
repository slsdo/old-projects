A Rider-class Servant in Altera’s army.
He was born in the 4th century BC to the royal family of Macedonia, a kingdom in Greece.
Thanks to the influence of his mother, Olympias, he was fascinated by the exploits of heroes in mythology. He believed that he was the son of Zeus (regarded to be one and the same as the Egyptian god Amun).
He inherited the throne at the young age of twenty, and began his great conquest by uniting the Grecian states.
He raised an army and led them in a campaign to the East, not only conquering the great kingdom of Persia, but also many of the kingdoms under its control, including Egypt.
The name Iskandar was given to him by the Arabs and the Persians. His campaign to the East went as far as India. There, his troops and generals complained of fatigue, and so he turned back to Babylon, where he suddenly passed away.
As a conqueror he created the greatest empire in the history of mankind, but his dying words, “Only the strongest should rule the empire,” ended up splitting it apart instead.
Today, the Heroic Spirit Iskandar is a Top Servant, known among his peers as the “King of Conquerors.”
When the Moon Cell senses that Altera has been released, it summons Iskandar to do battle with her. However, being unaccustomed to fighting on SE.RA.PH., with all its subtle differences to the Earth he lived and died on, he approaches the fight as a kind of warm-up.
Of course, he loses. Altera then declares that his life belongs to her and forces him to join her army. (This sort of thing is bound to happen when you don’t play with your full attention on the game…)
This also makes him a Servant of the Main Character, but in the game he is treated in similar fashion to Altera.
Altera understands that her victory over Iskandar was a matter of luck, and that they are evenly matched in terms of strength. Iskandar understands that as well, but accepts his defeat with dignity. From then on, he pledges to assist Altera in achieving her goals.
Make no mistake, however: He is loyal only to Altera, and not the Umbral Star.
