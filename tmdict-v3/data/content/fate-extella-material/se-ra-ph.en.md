SERIAL PHANTASM.
The virtual spiritron world that was created within the Moon Cell.
When the Moon Cell grew to a great size, it created this city-shaped engine in the form of an additional layer in order to manage itself.
A human can only view the Moon Cell’s network as pure light, but a Wizard who can turn his or her being into spiritrons can perceive a network of pure information, and join as a node of the network.
The “Moon’s Holy Grail War,” which was held for the purpose of understanding humans, made use of SE.RA.PH as well.
SE.RA.PH was fragmented within the Moon Cell, and although some pieces were deemed obsolete and deleted, there were still individual areas that have yet to crumble. However, when it was reborn as the new SE.RA.PH, all of the scattered territories merged together, and they are still in the process of becoming one giant open world.
