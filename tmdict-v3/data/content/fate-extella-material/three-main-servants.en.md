The three main Servants in EXTELLA are Nero, Tamamo no Mae, and Altera. All of them have broad but multilayered personalities.
Nero seems to be selfish, tyrannical, and free-spirited, but is actually an infatuated lover.
Tamamo seems to be self-absorbed, poison-tongued, and hedonistically whimsical, but is actually a truly dedicated wife.
Altera seems to be a cool, solitary goddess of destruction, but is actually filled with maternal instincts (more like friendship between pure maidens).
