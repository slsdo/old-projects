Typically the skill of a Caster-class Servant.
Titan Altera also possesses this skill, at EX rank.
The purpose of this skill is to create a familiar that acts as an extension of its creator that can be controlled from afar. In Alteraâ€™s case, it is more like creating an alter ego or an avatar.
In need of a physical body to destroy civilization on earth, since her real body is made of information, Altera uploaded her data from the Moon and used the spiritrons on Earth to create a physical form.
This is how the fearsome White Titan appeared on Earth 14,000 thousand years ago. Altera also created an avatar in the form of a Servant, allowing her to move around freely inside of SE.RA.PH.
