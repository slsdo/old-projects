The containers that the predatory Umbral Star{{n1}} drops upon the domain that has been targeted as an object for harvest.
They are space vessels that lack the ability to navigate via spatial jumping, and are loaded with one fighting unit whose mission is to destroy civilization.
Altera’s Ark of the Stars is numbered “Velber 02.”
Each Ark has inherited the characteristics of a different alien civilization, so the contents of Velber 01 and Velber 03 are completely distinct organisms right down to their manner of existence.
