A Servant in Altera’s army. He has declared himself her second-in-command.
The King of Uruk, capital of ancient Mesopotamia.
He appears in ancient Mesopotamian legends, beginning with the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, which is said to be the oldest epic poem.
He is born of a union between god and man, and lays claim to all of the world’s myriad treasures as the “King of Heroes.”
Like Iskandar, he is a Top Servant.
Although the other two (knight-class) Servants of his rank were summoned by the Moon Cell, Gilgamesh appeared in this land of his own volition by ripping apart the border (when it fluctuated) inside SE.RA.PH that separates the Near Side of the moon from the Far Side.
(Note: Typically only those of 〇〇〇〇 class possess the skill to descend on the world of its own volition, but in the Extra Universe this is just barely within the rules.)
He has no connection to the Heroic Spirit Altera, but does have a previous connection with the White Titan on Earth, and so he lends his aid just this once in order to fulfill an obligation he made in the past.
He also has memories of the events that occurred on the Far Side of the Moon. However, neither the Main Character nor Altera know that this is the biggest reason for him joining Altera’s side.
