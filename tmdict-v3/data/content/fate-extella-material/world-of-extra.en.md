“The minds of people are now accustomed to regulation, and civilization is stagnant.
There are no great tragedies, but neither are there new discoveries.
Pessimism reigns supreme in this insipid world, where we can only bide our time until death. This is our reality.”
The world of EXTRA differs from that of *Fate/stay night* in that it follows an alternate history, with events having started to diverge in 1970. *Fate/EXTRA* and its sequels are set on Earth and the Moon, starting in 2030.
Mana, the energy required to perform large-scale magecraft, has dried up. True magic has been lost from the Earth.
The magicians of old have disappeared from center stage, and the era of magic has drawn to a complete close. A new generation of “Wizards,” technological hackers, rises.
