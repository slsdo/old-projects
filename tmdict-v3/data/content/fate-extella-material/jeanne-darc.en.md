Jeanne is a Ruler-class Servant in Altera’s army.
She is world-renowned as the “Holy Maiden” and the savior of France in the Hundred Years War. Although the end of her story was far too tragic and cruel, she does not curse her own fate, but accepts it as she fights on with a soul of steel.
Like Iskandar, she is a Top Servant.
She acts as a peacekeeper after being summoned by the Moon Cell.
However, after she fights Altera, she realizes that Altera’s true nature is not evil, but that she is full of uncertainty. Jeanne joins Altera’s side in order to develop a better understanding of her.
She is much closer to Altera than the other two knight-class Servants.
“The Ruler who was trusted to handle the situation is making waves once again…” the rumor mill might say. It would seem that Jeanne’s penchant for running off and stirring up trouble remains a hot topic even in the Servant world. “…what a cruel twist of fate.”
