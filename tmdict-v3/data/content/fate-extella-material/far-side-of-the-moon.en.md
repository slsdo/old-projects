This refers not to the side of the Moon that you cannot see from the Earth, but to the other side of the Moon Cell’s internal structure.
The inner workings of the Moon Cell are divided into the Near Side and the Far Side, top and bottom, each in the shape of a half-moon.
The Far Side of the Moon is somewhat analogous to a giant “hell” that lies beneath the Earth’s crust.
Because the Moon Cell trashes information that it cannot understand, as well as unneeded divergences in human history, to its Far Side, that “side” of the Moon is a pool of chaos where innumerable curses and delusions flourish.
