An enormous altar, which Titan Altera uses as a bed in her cavern.
At some point in the past, she saw the roof of a temple she had conquered and thought, “Oh, that’s just the right size. I could sleep well on that.” Altera would never admit it, but it is one of her favorite things.
Just as there are secrets under everyone’s bed, Altera’s secrets are hidden inside of the altar.
In the initial planning stages of the game, we wanted to create a sequence of events where you’d think, “Oh, the Anti-Cell must be in that temple!” And then we’d say, “I’m sorry, the temple is just a bed and the Anti-Cell is the person asleep on top of it.” Unfortunately, we simply didn’t have the budget to make a dungeon out of it.
