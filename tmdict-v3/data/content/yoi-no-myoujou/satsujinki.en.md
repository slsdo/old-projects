The person Merem called Satsujinki{{n1}}. Needless to say, it was that person.
One year after the story of *Tsukihime*, he gradually became a rumor. Such was the fame of this person.
He was still the same fool with a knife-fetish.
By the way, he still kept the whimsical Princess company while ceaselessly complained. It seemed he came all the way to Germany not because of the whim of the Princess, but due to the tip of some third party.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} “Killer Shiki” and “Killer Demon” are homophones, both are “Satsujinki.” Word play.
