A member of the Twenty-Seven Dead Apostle Ancestors. Number Seven.
Most Dead Apostles were concerned about balancing their needs for blood and the sustainability of the society, but there were also Dead Apostles with values unchanged since the Middle Ages and sucked blood with reckless abundance.
Einnashe was such a Dead Apostle.
However, due to its peculiar nature, it was difficult to eliminate it. As a result, it was currently siphoning blood without control.
It was thought to be a Reality Marble.
