The person Merem called Princess. Needless to say, it was that person.
To True Ancestors, she was Hades, but Merem was quite fond of her.
Merem seemed to assist the Princess in chores such as trading gold for money, booking plane tickets, etc.
The Princess did not really know what to do with Meremâ€™s unconditional affection, but without him, she would have much trouble roaming around the world.
During this story, she was peacefully slumbering in her hideout.
