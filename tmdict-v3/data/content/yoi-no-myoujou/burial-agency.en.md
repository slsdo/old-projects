The Inquisitors of the Church who were given special privileges. However, since they were not actually responsible for stamping out heresy, they were also called Executors or killers.
Their policies had always been “shoot first and report later.”
Faith was secondary, the only necessity for the job was the power to obliterate the heretical.
From the outside, it seemed like the ranks of the Burial Agency was filled with magi who loved to explore the taboo, people who enjoyed enslaving the captured heretics, gun nuts, and maniacs with insatiable bloodlust.
It consisted of seven members, with one on reserve.
The reserved member was always an exceptional candidate from the Church, but it kept changing because the person kept dying during missions.
