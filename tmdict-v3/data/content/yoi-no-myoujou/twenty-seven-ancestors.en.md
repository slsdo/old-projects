The oldest 27 Dead Apostles.
However, some had already been succeed by the next generation of Dead Apostles. Nowadays it mostly referred to the distinct factions that existed among the Dead Apostles.
The Ancestors established their kingdoms consisted of Territories, Dead Apostles, and the Dead. However, some exceptional Ancestors had neither a Territory nor coven.
The Vampires who were subordinates of True Ancestors favored Territories, but those Ancestors who became Vampires as a culmination of pursuing magecraft had very little interest in such power.
