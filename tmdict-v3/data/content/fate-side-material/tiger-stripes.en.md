The pattern on Fuji-neeâ€™s clothes.
Some of you may have noticed, but those stripes are without a doubt tiger stripes.
At first we were going to have Fuji-nee wear normal clothes at school and casual clothes at home, but before we knew it she was rocking the tiger stripes nonstop.
It seems Fuji-nee harbors complex feelings toward tigers, which were revealed in the Tiger Dojo Special.
