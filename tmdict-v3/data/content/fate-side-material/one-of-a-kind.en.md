Sprites that were only used once in the entire story.
*Fate/stay night* boasts an absolutely ridiculous number of character sprites, but there are some that were made especially for specific scenes, that players could go the entire game without seeing depending on what choices they made.
Some examples would be things like Saber after taking a bath, Rin looking down shyly, Rin giving a hug, and the comically angry Saber.
Also, strangely enough there were even sprites that were made but went unused.
Between the extensive play time and the Tiger Dojos, itâ€™s not the really most streamlined game around, huh?
