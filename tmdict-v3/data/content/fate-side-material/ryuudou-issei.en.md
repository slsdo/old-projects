A male student in Class 2-C, and the student council president.
He first became acquainted with Shirou two years ago, and soon became his friend.
Though he has a straight-laced and serious personality, that doesn’t mean he’s stubborn or inflexible.
As the youngest child of Ryuudou Temple, it seems he has his heart set on one day becoming a Buddhist monk. Though, he’ll be the first to tell you that his ability to sense the supernatural is weak.
He travels two hours on foot every single day to attend school. Apparently engaging in ascetic training in the mountains makes you a good walker.
He’s been acquainted with Rin for quite a while, and his distrust toward women probably stems from the behind-the-scenes feud they’ve been engaged in for the past two years. However, as much as it pains him to admit it he still recognizes Rin as a human being.
He looked up to Kuzuki Souichirou as a mentor, and on holidays they would often perform paired kata together. If he hadn’t gone into the student council, it’s a safe bet that he would have enrolled in the karate club instead.
His favorite food is Shirou’s boxed lunches.
