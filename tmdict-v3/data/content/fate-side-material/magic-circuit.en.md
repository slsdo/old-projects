Pseudo-nerves within the body of a magus.
Magic circuits are responsible for converting life force into magical energy, and for connecting to the underlying grand magecraft formula.
Because the number of magic circuits a person has is fixed at birth, magi lineages do what they can to improve themselves and create an heir with even one more magic circuit.
Once the magic circuits have been opened for the first time, the practitioner can switch them on and off at will.
Each practitioner visualizes the flipping of this switch in their own particular way. For Shirou, the image is that of a gun’s firing hammer, while for Rin it is stabbing a heart with a knife.
This image tends to be related to how the circuits were opened for the very first time, so there even those who
can only open their circuits through sexual arousal or self-harm.
By the way, Shirou’s number of magic circuits is an unexpectedly high 27.
Rin, on the other hand, has 40 main circuits, while her sub-circuits are 30 each.
