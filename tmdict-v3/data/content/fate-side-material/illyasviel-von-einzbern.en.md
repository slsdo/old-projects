A semi-heroine. Berserker’s Master.
In the story, she was a mysterious girl who approached the still-oblivious Shirou while calling him “big brother.”
She possesses innocence and cruelty in equal measure, and for some reason is interested in Shirou.
The kind of character that makes you feel like angels and devils might just be the same thing.
Her power as a Master is the greatest in history.
With a command spell engraved over her entire body and a magic circuit that overwhelms that of normal magi by an enormous margin, there is no doubt that she is an existence born for the sole purpose of winning the Holy Grail War.
Though she played a key role in every route, her true colors were only revealed in the last one. Until then, she was just a worrisome child that got along well with Shirou despite coming to Japan to kill him.
During the plotting stage, she actually had her own route.
However, if we had tried to make it, it would have delayed the release of *Fate/stay night* by another half a year. Rest in peace, Illya route.
