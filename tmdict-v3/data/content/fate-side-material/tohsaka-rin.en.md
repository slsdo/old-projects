Current head of the distinguished Tohsaka family, and one of the main heroines of *Fate/stay night*. As a Master, she spent just as much time quarreling with Shirou as she did cooperating with him.
Her manner of speech is often hostile and dismissive of other people, but deep down she has a caring, big-sisterly disposition.
Her tendency of making trivial mistakes at the worst possible moment is a hereditary curse.
Though she really is a lot nicer than she seems, in the end she always makes her decisions based on cold, rational logic. In her own words, it’s “not a very cute personality.”
There are even times when she thinks she might lack any sort of “girlishness” at all, and it’s starting to become something of a complex for her.
In fact, her choice in personal clothes is probably an overreaction to that. Still, showing that much leg… a pure and wholesome boy won’t know where to look. Please, try to bear with it, Shirou.
Her hobbies are admiring jewels and bullying Shirou. She’s a mischievous girl at heart, so she loves teasing serious people. Please, try to bear with it, Shirou.
As far as magecraft goes, she specializes in the flow and conversion of magical energy.
Since it’s not a magecraft trait well-suited for combat, she stores away magical energy in jewels ahead of time, and uses them as disposable, limited-function mystic codes.
Aside from that, she also practices pseudo-karate as a form of self-defense.
Her instructor in martial arts is Kotomine. That fake priest was responsible for the sequence of moves she used to corner Caster.
By the way, she had the most screen time out of every character in *Fate/stay night*.
