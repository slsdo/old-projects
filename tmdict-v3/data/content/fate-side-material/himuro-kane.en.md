A member of Class 2-A’s famed track girl trio. She generally plays the straight man of the group.
She is the track team’s high-jumping ace. If you’re wondering whether or not she hates having such an old-fashioned name as “Kane,” she’s actually really fond of it.
It seems she actually wants to paint pictures, but was strong-armed into joining the track team by Makidera Kaede.
