Fuji-nee.
A mysterious woman who hangs around the Emiya residence. Well, really she’s just an English teacher. Her primary goal in life is to kick back and take it easy at Shirou’s house.
She hates the fact that her name is Taiga, and if you call her Tiger she’ll get mad. And cry.
Her personality is like the sun, but her self-indulgent tendencies make me worry about her prospects for the future…
In Sakura’s true end, everybody else has grown up and matured, but Fuji-nee is the same as ever. In fact, I suspect she hasn’t aged a day since twenty.
She was a famed swordswoman in her student days, and was the kendo club’s idol. Also, she has been frequently visiting the Emiya residence ever since Emiya Kiritsugu moved in.
It seems that for her, meeting Kiritsugu was something like love at first sight, and she would always end up quarrelling with Shirou when she came over. Eventually, though, they made up, and settled into their current relationship.
A character loved by the entire staff. During the
plotting stage, she was more of a proper older sister type.
…Weird, it’s weird. What kind of terrible blunder is
responsible for turning her into her current form…?
