A supervisor dispatched by the Association and the Holy Church.
He secretly operated as the Master of Archer in the previous war, and as the Master of Lancer in the current one.
In his early twenties, he was selected as a participant in a Holy Grail War supervised by his father. Afterward, under the guise of “being dispatched” from the Church, he entered the Association.
As one of the only survivors of the Fourth Holy Grail War, he inherited the role of supervisor.
He is qualified as an executor of the Church, and he specializes in spiritual healing.
Of course, despite being a first-class executor, he is still no match for the seventh member of the Burial Agency.
His excellent attack power against spiritual bodies is a testament to his unwavering (albeit distorted) faith.
Though he seems to enjoy destruction, he is actually a magus of “creation” just like Shirou. His ability to heal spiritual and mental injuries is at the level of a priest.
Wicked, but not a villain. Depraved, but not cruel.
He is the ultimate antagonist of *Fate/stay night*
If Archer is an existence that shines light on Shirou’s distortion, then Kotomine is a dark wall that brings it into stark relief.
His initial concept was “somebody you’d know is the mastermind behind everything the instant you met him.”
