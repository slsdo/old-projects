Shooting Hundred Heads.
Heroic Spirit Heracles’ most trusted Noble Phantasm.
It was the bow used to slay the Lernaean Hydra, whose nine heads would always regenerate no matter how many times they were cut off. Afterward, Heracles perfected a method of attacking that emulated the abilities of the bow, that could even be used with great swords. If Heracles’ class was Saber, that glorious, exquisite swordplay would have definitely made its return.
…By the way, what cut down the blackened Berserker in the Sakura route was this secret sword technique, projected from Berserker together with the axe sword.
