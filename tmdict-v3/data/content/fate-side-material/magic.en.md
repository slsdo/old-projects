A mystery distinct from magecraft. The final destination of magi.
“Magic” is that which makes the impossible into the possible, for a given era. A “result” which can be realized with the application of time and effort is not magic.
In the past, when civilization was young, most magi were also magicians, but currently only five remain.
…Well, that’s what they say, but there are actually only four still alive.
The magician that handled the First magic already died a long, long time ago.
Of the remaining four, two have disappeared, and two are bothersome people that pop up all over the place leaving trouble in their wake.
