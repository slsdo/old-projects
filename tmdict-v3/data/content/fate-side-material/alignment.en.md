In *Fate/stay night*, all of the Servants’ alignments can be viewed on their respective status screens. The first part indicates the principles they consider important, and the second part indicates personality.
Below is a complete list of alignments featured in the game, for comparison purposes.

<table>
  <tr><td>Saber</td><td>Lawful Good</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Lancer</td><td>Lawful Neutral</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Archer</td><td>True Neutral</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Rider</td><td>Chaotic Good</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Caster</td><td>Neutral Evil</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Berserker</td><td>Chaotic Insane</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Assassin</td><td>Lawful Evil</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Kojirou</td><td>Neutral Evil</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Gilgamesh</td><td>Chaotic Good</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Saber Alter</td><td>Lawful Evil</td></tr>
</table>

While a difference in personality generally won’t be too much of a problem, a difference in principles will inevitably lead to friction.
Saber and Gil would be a good example of that.
