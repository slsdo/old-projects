The short episode you get by choosing to go see Saber in the dojo at night on the tenth day of the Rin route.
It’s a comical dialog that provides a brief glimpse at Saber’s profound (and long-held) discontent toward the food she was served in life.
By the way, whether or not their food is actually “wild” in real life comes down to personal tastes, so don’t come crying to me about it, okay?
