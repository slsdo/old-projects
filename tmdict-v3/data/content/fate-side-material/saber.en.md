Heroic Spirit of the sword. A type of Servant that requires above average abilities in every basic parameter except for MGI.
Also, one of the main heroines of the story. A maiden knight that formed a contract with Emiya Shirou and fought to the very end of the Holy Grail War.
Her personality is righteous and thoroughly serious, and any sort of femininity she might have had has long since been usurped by her pride as a knight.
…However, if you strip away that veneer, a girlish aspect befitting her age will reveal itself.
She holds grudges when she’s sulking, and gets so sucked into competitions that she totally forgets about her surroundings. She gets overly excited about delicious food, and frets about making mistakes in front of the person she likes.
Honestly, she’s a hard to please heroine, umu.
Her true identity is King Arthur.
She disguised herself as a man to become king and brought peace to her homeland, but afterward lost her life during a civil war that tore her country apart from within.
The King Arthur in *Fate/stay night* is treated as a fusion of myth and historical fact. Her name before becoming king was Artoria.
Living in the castle while hiding her gender was an endless string of stressful situations. The matter of producing an heir was particularly troublesome, but it seems that she managed to get by without any problems thanks to Merlin’s spell. In the story, when she said that “she knows how to please a man,” she was speaking from actual experience.
She stopped aging the moment she pulled the sword of selection, so physically she’s about a year younger than Shirou.
Also, King Arthur is the red dragon that protects Britain.
Due to an arrangement her father, King Uther Pendragon, made with Merlin to produce an heir bearing the essence of a dragon, Artoria was born as a human infused with a dragon’s magical energy.
Consequently, she has no need for magic circuits. Her every breath, the very circulation of her blood, it all naturally generates magical energy. It wouldn’t be wrong to call her very being a “magic reactor,” on a completely different level from magi.
———*Fate/stay night* was originally her story.
At its conception, the main themes revolved around King Arthur and the Holy Grail, and that fact alone has never changed.
A maiden knight who galloped through the Holy Grail War.
I want to believe that the dream she saw at the very end was one worthy of her life.
