Assets that were created, but never used. Primarily refers to character sprites.
I don’t know what made us think it would be a good idea, but going into *Fate/stay night* we had this crazy idea to have a far, middle, and zoom version of every single sprite in the game.
By the time we were finished, we had over 3600 images just counting the character sprites alone. It was totally ridiculous, and there was no way we could possibly use them all. If we had kept them the game would have taken up four whole discs, so we tearfully went through and deleted everything that went unused.
Next time, let’s shoot for a little more optimization. I’m thinking a nice, simple game that you can beat in two hours, how’s that sound?
