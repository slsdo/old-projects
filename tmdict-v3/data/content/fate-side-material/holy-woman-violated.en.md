The interlude where Saber was captured by Caster.
The pure white dress was due to Caster’s tastes. It seems she was crazy about Gothic Lolita fashion, but since she couldn’t pull it off herself she enjoyed playing around with young girls instead.
…Does she not have a spell for restoring youth?
(Also, Saber’s dress wasn’t Gothic Lolita.)
If you ask me, it was the most erotic scene in the whole entire game. Way to go, Caster. Keep it up!
