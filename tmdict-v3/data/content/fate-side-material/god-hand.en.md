Twelve Labors.
Immortality granted by a blessing (curse) from the gods. It transforms the user’s body into powerful armor that nullifies all attacks of Rank B and below.
On top of that, it has a revival effect that automatically activates upon death. The number of revivals in stock is eleven.
…In that case, could it be? The reason Berserker’s body was colored like lead and covered in weird protrusions was all because of God Hand!?
Anyway, putting it fighting game terms, it’s a ridiculous Noble Phantasm that applies Super Armor + No Damage to every attack outside of Super Combos.
You’re strong, Berserker.
