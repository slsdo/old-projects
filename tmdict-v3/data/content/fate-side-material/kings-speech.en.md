Gilgamesh’s peculiar way of speaking. Written one way, but read another.
It’s about as self-important as you can get. Even when he was being dragged into the Holy Grail, Gilgamesh was still able to talk down to Shirou like this.
Incidentally, Gil gets mad when people speak to him without first being spoken to. It’s like, “Who the hell does this commoner think he is, addressing the king out of turn!?”
