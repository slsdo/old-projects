A member of Class 2-A’s famed track girl trio. She is the track team’s star sprinter, and wishes people would call her the Black Panther of Homura. Her actual nickname is just “Maki.”
She’s scheming at making the honor student Tohsaka Rin her best friend, and sees Mitsuzuri Ayako as a rival.
Her hobby is collecting wind chimes, and she loves working with glass. Perhaps because her tastes intersect with Rin’s on that point, the two often go around visiting antique shops together on their days off.
