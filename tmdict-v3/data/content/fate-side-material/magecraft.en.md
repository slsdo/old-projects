A general term for the act of artificially reenacting mysteries and miracles.
Although each school has its individual differences, it is basically a mechanism for using the magical energy in the practitioner’s body or the outside world, in order to reenact a predetermined phenomenon.
The practitioner sends an order (command) to the foundation (system) controlled by their school, and a pre-made function (program) is executed.
The “electrical current” needed to send that command and execute the program is magical energy.
Though magecraft may seem almighty, it is basically the bringing about of mysteries by means of equivalent exchange.
Even the exceptionally talented Rin, in exchange for her versatile magecraft trait, will find herself afflicted by a chronic lack of money her entire life.
Also, magecrafts that affect other people’s minds and change the course of their thoughts require no physical compensation, but the practitioner will inevitably find their own thoughts being pulled in that altered direction as well. As the saying goes, before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.
Because the study of curses is looked down upon as unscholarly by the Association, they have fallen far behind the Middle East in that particular field.
