Destroyer of All Marks.
A dagger that can destroy any magecraft.
It is an anti-magecraft Noble Phantasm, that returns any objects strengthened with magical energy, connections bound by contracts, or life forms created out of magical energy, to a state prior to their “creation.”
Of course, there are limits. No matter how low the rank, it is impossible for Rule Breaker to affect a Noble Phantasm.
It is truly a Noble Phantasm befitting Caster, and was used to capture and monopolize Saber.
An unassumingly fearsome Noble Phantasm.
