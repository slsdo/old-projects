Yeah! Here it is, what you’ve all been waiting for! The heart and soul of romance games!
A heroine without one of these can’t really even be called a heroine at all, and any main heroine worth her salt should have at least one or two.
Because of that, both Saber and Rin have date scenes.
One date where Shirou does the dragging, and one date where he’s the one being dragged. I think it demonstrates the positions of both heroines quite nicely, yes.
…But wait, now that I think about it, isn’t there another main heroine who didn’t get a date scene at all…?
