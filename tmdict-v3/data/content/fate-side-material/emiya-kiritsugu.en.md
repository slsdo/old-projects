A freelance magus, who died at the age of 34.
For better or worse, the person that decided Shirou’s way of life.
He was Emiya Shirou’s adoptive father, and the Master of Saber in the previous Holy Grail War, which he fought his way through to the very end.
He favored guns, and used a peculiar magecraft called Innate Time Control.
His aptitude as a Master was normal, but he was the best of the best when it came to “killing hostile magi.”
Basically, he was the Association’s hitman, and it seems the Einzberns sought him out to make use of those skills.
It seems that over the course of the Holy Grail War, he tricked an enemy Master, took his lover hostage, blew up a building, and was generally nasty enough that you could almost mistake him for a young Kotomine.
…Well, Kotomine himself was young back then, too.
Perhaps it’s the fate of lady’s man, but he casually kept both a wife and lover.
It seems that when he wasn’t working as a magus, he was extremely chivalrous. He used to tell the young Shirou to “never make a woman cry, since later there will be hell to pay.”
…Huh? Did this guy actually like women at all?
At any rate, after the Holy Grail War he was stained by “All the World’s Evil” called forth by Kotomine, which ultimately caused his death.
