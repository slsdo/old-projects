The Saber Servant that made a contract with Kanata. A Servant specialized in close-quarters combat that possesses both immense skill and agility. She also possesses an extremely powerful trump card that allowed her to erase the space between her and Archer, who fought at long range. Due to the fact she wears that extremely famous haori, figuring out her identity was easy, but Archer still has no idea who she is, so she couldn’t figure out her name.
Usually, Saber’s considered the strongest class due to having the best overall stats, but it would seem that in her case, her base stats are actually quite low.
