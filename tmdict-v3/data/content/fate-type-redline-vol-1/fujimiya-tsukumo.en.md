The 5th head of the Fujimiya family. 17 years old. She uses magecraft that allows her to channel her mana into liquids and control them like mist. However her skill level isn’t that great, making her more or less a very average magus. She’s the head of the Fujimiya family, who goes down a path of constant decline with each generation. Through the connections of her predecessors, she managed to obtain an invitation to the Holy Grail War from the Church, and burning with conviction, hope for the future, and hoping to restore her family, she set out to summon a Heroic Spirit, but was suddenly interrupted by Kanata and had Saber stolen by him. “Why did this happen…?”
