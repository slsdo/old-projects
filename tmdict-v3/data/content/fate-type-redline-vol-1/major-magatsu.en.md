A consultant magus from the Imperial Army. 24 years old. He comes from a family of magi who specialized in ancient magecraft to communicate with dead spirits. Due to the current Holy Grail War, he was especially invited into the Army. Unlike Fujimiya, heâ€™s a magus from a family with far greater history and pedigree, but Magatsu himself seems to prefer climbing up the ladder of normal society rather than that of magi society.
