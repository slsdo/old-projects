A proof of supreme authority over their own Servant, given to each Master chosen by the Holy Grail. Possessing these is proof that one is an official Master chosen by the Grail. Each Master possesses three of these and they can be used to force Servants to do certain things, or to power them up. The more immediate and straightforward the order is, the more powerful the Command Sealâ€™s effect is, and the longer-lasting and vague the order is, the weaker the effect becomes.
