Saber’s Master. 17 years old. The oldest son of a family that quit the ways of magecraft in his father’s generation. He currently goes by his mother’s last name. As a magus, he’s a mediocre one who can merely decrease the speed of any object he touches. As for his personality, he’s just like any other modern human in that he’s become much too accustomed to peace. Having nothing to call a conviction of his own, he was thrown into the Holy Grail War through a crazy series of coincidences. By the way, he has a younger sister who apparently had potential and talent, so she separated herself from their family and became a freelancing magus.
