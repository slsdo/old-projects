A division of the army created with the intention of utilizing and developing magecraft-based weapons in preparation for the Great War. Archer was summoned as one of the first stages of their plan, but to their surprise, she ended up taking part of the Imperial Army under her own control instead. Usually, this would be the time when Japan allowed the country to be air-raided, but through Archer’s efforts, they’ve brought the war situation on their coastline to a halt.
