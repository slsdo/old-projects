Magecraft-based weapons created through replicating the summoning of Heroic Spirits that occur during a Holy Grail War, but without using support from the Grail. By using organic parts, it is possible to produce fake Servant soldiers.
This would usually be something impossible to accomplish, but through use of a certain theory this project was able to “become realized without being realized”. Unlike the normal Servant summoning, a single Master could control a varying number of these, and instead of the usual three Command Seals, the Masters only get one for emergency use. As their name implies, these are meant to be used as heroic spirit soldiers. However, due to merely being fake Servants, their ability is nowhere near that of a real one.
