Well, this is the end, but allow me to introduce myself as Keikenchi, the author of the work this manga is based on. I could have never expected that Legend of the Imperial Capital would have gotten a remake manga. This is such a wonderful thing that I can’t say anything but “Awesome!”. Many thanks to Hirano Ryouji! Please look forward to seeing in future volumes what the Shinsengumi’s Saber and the Mysterious Archer will do next. It’s sure to make you go “Eh? What? Who are these people!?”
