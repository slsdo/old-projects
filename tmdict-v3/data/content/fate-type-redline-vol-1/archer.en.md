A mysterious Servant who controls a large number of rifles. Befitting the name Archer, she boasts incredible power when fighting from a distance, but the fact that sheâ€™s usually supposed to consume great amounts of mana makes her a difficult Servant to use. However, due to certain reasons, the problem of her mana consumption has been resolved.
One would not be able to tell from her appearance, but her true identity is that of the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga.
