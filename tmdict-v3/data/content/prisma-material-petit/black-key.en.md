Conceptual armament adopted by the Holy Church. Since they are seen a lot they are thought to be a basic armament for every agent of the Church but that’s not the case, it’s very difficult to handle, and a weapon with suppressive power used for the first time by the expert class. In the Church of nowadays, where the usage of modern weapons is allowed, people stepping back and saying “Wow, is that agent using Black Keys…? They’re a training maniac. They’re a training maniac” are often seen.
Shirou, who was losing his temper for not being able to break the Ainsworth’s Bounded Field no matter how much time passed, when he urged ‘Anything is fine so lend me a conceptual armament, you have something good, huh?,’ they were sold to him at a price with which he could buy a new game console.
By the way, in the original work *Fate* they are given away for free. It may be for the difference of relationship between both, or due to the difference of intention, but more importantly the reason may be because this Kotomine is a “merchant” for the time being. The one who runs the store is severe about money payments. It’s not like he will never overcharge. The price of ramen? Market value.
