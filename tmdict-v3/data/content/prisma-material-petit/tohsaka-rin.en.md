Pretty girl that somehow came out by accident in the end, No. 1.
In the original work *Fate*, she was supposed to be a great justice heroine who was a perfect superhuman and the schoolâ€™s idol with the tsun and the dere and showed to be actively competent in all fields, but oh how did she become like this.
Since in *Priya* the protagonist is an elementary school student, her side as an old sister or a protector is emphasized no matter what. Even if there are scenes in which she feels older or more mature, I would want you to think that is an expression due to it depending on a bias by the viewpoint of an elementary school student.
