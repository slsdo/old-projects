A church modestly standing in Shinto, at the east side of the Mion river. It became the base of the character with the role of supervisor of the Holy Grail War.
Currently, Kirei is working as a priestâ€¦ He should, but it seems he is mostly away. Without any believers to visit it either, the raising of plants has also been completely forgotten.
