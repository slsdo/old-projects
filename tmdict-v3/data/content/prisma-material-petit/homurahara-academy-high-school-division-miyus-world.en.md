The school that Shirou and others attend. Many students attended it in the past, but currently it has been depopulated to a few students per school year. I donâ€™t understand at all how the hell they manage it.
For some reason the archery club can be active in such a state. It seems there was another member in the past, but since they moved out of the city, currently the club activities are done by Shirou and Sakura alone. It looks like it has become a bonus time for Sakura.
