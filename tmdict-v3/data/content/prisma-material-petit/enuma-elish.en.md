Star of Creation that Split Heaven and Earth.
A freaking strong Noble Phantasm. An official cheat that will one-hit KO almost every Heroic Spirit if shot from the beginning.
If it’s Gilgamesh himself, he won’t draw it recklessly due to personal restraints, but Angelica-san, who didn’t know a damn about the dignity of a hero, fired it quickly. Shirou attempted to offset it by mobilizing all the swords within the Bounded Field, and failed. He succeeded in attenuating it considerably, but was defeated with the breaking of the Bounded Field. At this time, the wound inflicted in the space of the Great Cavern by Ea did that to the location and became like this, and Illya’s world and Miyu’s world were shifting or something like that. As expected from an Anti-World Noble Phantasm!
A simple method of calculating the output is STR×20, in short, the power will increase the higher the Strength. It’s a real relief that Angelica isn’t beefed. By the way, when Child Gil shot it against Illya, it was considerably weaker than the original.
