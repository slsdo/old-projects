A boy under some stress. The bags under his eyes are terrible.
I think there certainly was something like a friendship. He won’t want to admit it, but the basis of his personality can be immature, vulgar, and embarrassing. 
The initial concept was something like “mix the wakame and the temple boy and let it simmer under a stressful environment.”
