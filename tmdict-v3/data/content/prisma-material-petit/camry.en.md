The car Kiritsugu used to ride. As a means of transports in Japan, he suitably used his discretion to choose it from a secondhand car dealer.
It has an excellent number of sales in Japan of course, and overseas. He chose it because itâ€™s an economy car that will not stand out anywhere in the world, and because it has power within its capacities.
The initial plan I thought was to make him ride the king of economy cars, the Corolla, but since the combination of Kiritsugu + Corolla suggested a refreshing father at holidays, it was rejected. I also think it suits him too much.
