A kouhai-type heroine. In *Priya*, it’s not quite unusual that girls in this age group are treated as heroines…
She was a girl that had some various circumstances at home, wore a depressed expression in the past, and didn’t utter many words. However due to the erosion incident five years ago, her old brother, uncle, father, mother, grandfather, and ■, they all died all at once. She suddenly became a person without a single relative. But, putting it the other way around, that means that “what restrained Sakura” was mostly gone. After meeting Shirou, she embraced her first love, and the little girl finally learnt to laugh like a little girl.
In a state with no rivals, she expressed her affection to Shirou so directly that it’s embarrassing to see, but alas Shirou’s consciousness was stuck to Kiritsugu and Miyu so it didn’t have quite the effect. Now that she can finally point her heart to the outside, Sakura’s approaches might reach Shirou.
