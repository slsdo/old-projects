The last boss position in this work. She can only be seen as a mysterious big-breasted girl if only the movie is watched. “But I love Boing-chan,” comments a passing by hypha-type.
The Card she uses is the Archer Card, Gilgamesh. A renderer of distinguished service who has stood in the way many times through the original story and sprayed over valuable bouncy components.
Mostly expressionless, a person who only expresses an intentional anger. Before being replaced by a puppet, the past Angelica was said to be an intellectual and gentle woman.
