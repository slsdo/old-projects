Third person: A hero of justice. He only saves the figure of “a number of lives,” not “people.” It seems to be a sense of justice brought about by a personal history approximately similar to the original work *Fate*.
But in this world he’s more immature, half-hearted, and lenient. Since he saved a boy who didn’t need to be saved, he couldn’t abandon him, and couldn’t become his guardian or teacher. By letting him be an imitation of an assistant he gave him a reason to stay at his side, but he didn’t show him gruesome killings. After having cast away the affection and trust that were directed unilaterally, he won’t let go of the hand he holds.
