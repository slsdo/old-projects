The protagonist of the main story.
No doubt, this one is absolutely the protagonist. The thing is, her name is in the title.
…So, the unfortunate Illya-san nearly didn’t have any screentime despite the commemorative movie. This movie is a story from before the “protagonist of the previous work,” so to speak, passed the baton to the protagonist Illya-san. So please deal with it.
Prisma☆Illya is the story of how Illya, who was entrusted with a wish and a destiny, aims for a happy ending. That’s a light that can be seen because she is none other than herself. That’s why, come on, don’t lose your nerves because you didn’t have screentime, and do what you can do. Specifically, sales of advance tickets or figures or something like that.
