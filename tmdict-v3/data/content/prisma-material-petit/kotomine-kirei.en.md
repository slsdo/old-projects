The shopkeeper of the extremely hot ramen shop “麻.” It is read not as “Asa” but as “Maa.”
However, his true identity is a martial artist priest from the Holy Church. He assumed a role at Fuyuki Church as the supervisor of the Holy Grail War that the Ainsworth set up. That said, the Holy Church of this world doesn’t have power anymore, and he isn’t more than a bystander under the name of a supervisor. Specially since the Fifth, he doesn’t interfere with the staged Holy Grail War set up by Julian. Functionally, he’s an old man that will appear suddenly and explain things with amazingly long sentences.
A black saint whose sense of assessment of beauty and ugliness or good and evil has been collapsed by birth. He wasn’t aware of his true nature, and continued self-harming in the name of faith. He wanted an objective to live. But the world just headed slowly towards the end, and he lost the passion and faith in people. Wasn’t there anything on this world that was enough for him to devote himself to begin with? When he reached that resignation, he encountered that.

― Mapo.

It was a shock. That redness was passion. That spiciness was the rhythm of life. His tongue that should have already died was woken up by the violent piquancy, and the gushing out umami became an electric signal that shorted the old circuits. The world had robbed people of faith. But food is still there, and continues burning life as sustenance. O’ Lord, is this the answer? I think he doesn’t know what he’s saying, but I don’t really know it either. Please understand it with your soul.
After this and that happened, he worked out the way of making mapo tofu through self-instruction, and opened an extremely hot mapo tofu ramen shop ignoring his job at the Church. Why didn’t he honestly open a Chinese restaurant? As the initial concept, he was “a Kotomine that didn’t fight his own contradictions.” The gag elements are strong due to the *Priya* space so it can’t be helped.
