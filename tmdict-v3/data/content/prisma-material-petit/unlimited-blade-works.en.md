Reality Marble, Infinite Creation of Swords.
A different world from this one, the imagined world that a man whose Origin became “Sword” due to certain circumstances reached. It was High-Thaumaturgy that the Shirou from this world originally couldn’t reach, but it became usable for a limited time after being corroded by the Heroic Spirit of a Card.
That imagined landscape is a snowy field in the dark night. Without stars or roads, and only just the crescent moon faintly illuminates Shirou. The innumerable stuck swords give the impression of the mountain of corpses that that Heroic Spirit saw. It’s a space supplied with every sword from every time and place, and swords come flying to Shirou’s hands, or to the enemy, the instant he wishes for it. That is faster than Projection by far, and it even outdoes the speed at which swords are produced from The King’s Treasure.
That said, because it is helpless against swords that don’t exist within the Bounded Field, regarding Ig-Alima and Sul-sagana he could project them superficially right after seeing them, and somehow managed to do it by hitting them and averting their trajectory. This cheat style… So you have received the protection of the Holy Grail, haven’t you?
The instant Miyu flew to another world, the mana path was cut off, and he became unable to maintain the Reality Marble. As a result he lost the battle, but the wish of the big brother who wagered his life was granted. By the way, at this time Miyu’s world and Illya’s world changed places together with the space of the Great Cavern, but there is the trick of Shirou and Angelica not being affected since they were within the Reality Marble. I hate how complicated this is.
