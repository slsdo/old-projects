A youth in his late teens. A part-time worker, tenant of the Ogawa Apartment. He ran away from home. …an unusual individual. 
He had a small build and feminine features. He would be a bishounen if he maintained silence. He was aggressive and lacked tolerance, so he frequently got into fights. 
He encountered Shiki through some trivial matters, and gradually became involved in strange incidents.
———Of course, the gears had malfunctioned since the very beginning.
