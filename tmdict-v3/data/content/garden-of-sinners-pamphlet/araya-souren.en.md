A man looks to be about 45 years old. Magus.
A face carved with grief, a robust body unusual for a magus. These characteristics exert immense pressure on his opponents that seems almost nauseating.
Although Araya is average as a magus, his talents relating to Bound Field construction is exceptional.
A bound field divides what is inside from the outside. In order to construct a complete world from his own body, first Araya must complete himself. 
Araya, who has no exceptional talents, is able to become a first-class bound field master by completing himself through the accumulation of ages and sheer determination.
That which divides the inside from the outside, *Kara no Kyoukai* is his story.
Araya symbolizes the paradoxical spiral, the most important event in this tale.
Talking about the impossible, what Araya accomplished is like achieving the pinnacle within a field while being completely oblivious of even the name of this subject field.
Araya embodies the “accident of not knowing what is true and false,” and the “accident of not learning the truth that has become common knowledge.” As a result, it is absolute that the paradox will persist until the very end.
