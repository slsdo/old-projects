Magus. An old friend of Toukoâ€™s.
Rumor had it that this young man was the next director in line of the Sponheim Abbey, an organization within the Clock Tower.
Although he was fifty years old, he had the appearance of a handsome youth.
As a magus, his abilities were first rate, but his personalities were quite troublesome.
Although it did not appear in the story, his Familiar was a black hound. Alba, who could not easily love another person, favored creatures who could easily love people.
He had quite an air of a protagonist: donning his crimson long coat and top hat, strutting down the street with his black Doberman by his side.
