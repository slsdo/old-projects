She looks like a woman in her late 20s. Touko is the guide in this tale, yet at the same time she is an outsider. The owner of the Workshop, Garen no Dou.
She is one of the magi that appear in this tale, and makes a living by crafting puppets.
Touko is an individual with dual personalities, and the switch is made by putting on and taking off her glasses. With her glasses on, Touko is objective and ruthless; yet without her glasses, she is subjective and emotional. Which one is the real Aozaki Touko, even Touko herself does not really know. Emotional or not, Touko is fundamentally a romanticist.
Touko loves new things, and will tinker restlessly with things that she is interested in. She is also a speed demon.
Although *Kara no Kyoukai* will not be a story without Touko, she does not constitute the body of the tale.
Touko hates her name, yet she has a habit of always wearing one piece of orange-colored accessory.
Even though Touko has a younger sister, their relationship is extremely bad.
