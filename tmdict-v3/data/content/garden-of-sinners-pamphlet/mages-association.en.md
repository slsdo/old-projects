A self-defense organization formed by practitioners of magecraft, transcending nationality and genre. (Of course, this is in name only.)
Its mission is to manage, conceal, and develop magecraft.
It reserves the use of force to protect itself from entities that threaten its existence (the Church, other mage organizations, and individuals who hunt what they consider taboo). In order to promote the development (or regression?) of magecraft, the Association set up research institutions and established laws that forbid the criminal use of magecraft.
The headquarter of the Association is in London, England. It is also called the Clock Tower.
The Association is divided into three departments. Besides the Clock Tower, there are also the “Giant’s Pit” in the Atlas mountains in Egypt, and the “Sea of Astray,” the integrated association in Northern Europe. The “Sea of Astray” was the original Association that predated the Clock Tower, and had ceased communication with the Association since the Clock Tower became the headquarter.
Also, the Association deems the Magic Foundation of the Middle East and the philosophies of magecraft from the continent as incompatible with its teachings. Conversely, the other two schools also reject the Association.
Furthermore, as Alba stated in the story, the mage organizations in Japan did not join the Association.
