A man in his early 30s. He is the [older male] cousin of Kokutou Mikiya, and a police officer.
He likes his brother Mikiya, treating him as an equal friend despite the gap in age.
Daisuke is the type of man that treasures the smallest happiness. He has a strong sense of justice, but he is not bound by his own belief.
Due to some minor incident, Daisuke met the information broker Aozaki Touko. Since then, he has fallen into a one-sided love affair that cannot be realized. Daisuke is just this kind of mature man who can find joy in unrequited love.
