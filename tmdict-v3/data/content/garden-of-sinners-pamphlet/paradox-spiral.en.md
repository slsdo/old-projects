The title of the fifth chapter. The grand finale of the tale that was *Kara no Kyoukai Shi*.
This was the only chapter where Shiki was armed. It seemed that it was determined from the initial planning stage that there would be only one chapter where Shiki would wield a sword.
From the initial concept, it seemed the idea was “this would be the shortest chapter. If other chapters were one hour long when animated, this one would be thirty minutes.”
What were we thinking about at that time? This was truly worrisome.
