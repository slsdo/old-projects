{{n1}}
Ryougi Shiki’s special ability. Although it has some characteristics that are similar to the Mystic Eyes in magecraft, it is classified as an psychic power. 
Eyes of Direct Death allows the user to perceive the conceptual “Death of an Existence” as visual signals. Death emerges to the surface of an existence{{n2}} as lines. Cutting along the lines will result in “Death,” regardless of the constitution or properties of the object. 
Ryougi Shiki acquired this power after spending two years in a comatose state and contacted “ ” (kara) for a prolonged period of time. Shiki’s body already had the ability to perceive the Lines of Death, the accident merely awakened this power. 
Of course, Eyes of Direct Death is only one aspect of the powers of this body called “Ryougi Shiki.”
