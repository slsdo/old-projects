A contract-based production company operated by Aozaki Touko. Although the majority of the jobs were puppet-making, if Touko was interested, all sorts of jobs were accepted. It even produced anime. 
Almost no one approached the Garan no Dou because a Boundary Field was deployed over the workshop. People who had no business there avoided it subconsciously. 
It appeared to be an abandoned building, and it really was an abandoned building.
Touko purchased this building which was abandoned mid-construction and insisted on calling it her office. 
The first floor was just ruins. The second and third floors were where Touko worked. The fourth floor was the office. Mikiya and Shiki had only seen the fourth floor.
