The title of the first chapter, occurred in September 1998.
*Kara no Kyoukai* was itself a ridiculous story, and this chapter certain led the charge.
This chapter was written with the idea “if I go totally bonkers at the beginning and everyone accepts it, then I would be OK afterward no matter what I write.”
Although at the time I thought it was a gamble, in retrospect it was really common sense for a writer.
