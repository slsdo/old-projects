A luxury item that was not immediately apparent to the eye. It appeared to be an unremarkable kimono, but the quality was revealed in the fine details. If you ask which part of it is haute couture, it must be that Shiki could still perform high kicks while wearing a kimono.
In a related note, the early concept of Shiki was “a juxtaposition of Eastern and Western concepts.”{{n1}}
