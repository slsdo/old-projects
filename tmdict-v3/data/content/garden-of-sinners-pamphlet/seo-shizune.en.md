A girl in her late teens. A student of Reien Girls Academy. Kokutou Azaka’s roommate. Future sight.
A timid, introverted girl. She was incorporated into the story since the early draft in preparation of acting as the protagonist of *Gospel of the Future*.
Although she was not very active in the main story of *Kara no Kyoukai*, a character of similar concept emerged in the side story of *Tsukihime*{{n1}}.
*Gospel of the Future* would be a story about her chat with Mikiya. The setting would be Ahnenerbe. The planned length was about 30 pages.
In terms of chronological order, Gospel of the Future would take place before Paradox Spiral. In it, Sizune would advise Mikiya “if you keep going like this, you could die very soon.” In Paradox Spiral, the content of Mikiya’s reply to Enjou Tomoe was the exact opposite of that. It seemed Mikiya was lying there.
