Principal of Reien Girls Academy. Age unknown.
A pious Christian. When energized, she would engage in overzealous philanthropic activities due to her excessive faith.
The principalâ€™s office was decorated with a shield that would invoke the image of a violin.
Originally she was not an important character that would warrant an entry in this glossary, but since she showed up in other works, I had to pick her up.
