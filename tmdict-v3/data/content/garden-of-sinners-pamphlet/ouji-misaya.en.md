A girl in her late teens. A fairy-user. 
She was a student of the Reien Girls Academy, and an upperclassman of Kokutou Azaka. 
Misaya was a talented girl who was the chairwoman of the student committee until the last year, an impeccable mistress. 
Azaka once said, she was more of an intimidating empress rather than a cute princess.
She led the mindless familiars while conducted multiple parallel cognitive processes, demonstrating characteristics found in alchemists.
This was probably because the magus who acted as her mentor was a student of Atlas.
Although she clashed with Azaka like water and oil, their secret desires were very similar.
