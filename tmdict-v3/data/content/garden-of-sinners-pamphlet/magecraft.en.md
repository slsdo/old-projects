A general term representing activities that artificially reenact Mysteries/Miracles.
Although there were some differences depending on traditions and schools, the basic principle was still “the transformation of the magical energy that exists within the practitioner or the environment.”
The practitioner would issue Commands according to the Foundation (System) of his school, and this would cause the execution of a predetermined Program.
Magical energy was the electrical current required to deliver the command.
Although magecraft gave the impression of omnipotence, it fundamentally produced Mystery through the principle of equivalent exchange.
It was possible to transform one thing into another, but it was impossible to produce something from nothing.
However, the essence of magecraft as a discipline was to challenge that “Nothingness,” and endeavor towards the impossible. Large-scale spells such as the so-called Grand Sorceries, Grand Rituals were really purposeless if not for attempting to reach “ ” (kara) or True Magic.
*Kara no Kyoukai* was a story of one magus’ attempt at challenging “Nothingness.”
