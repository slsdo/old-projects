A twenty years old youth. Kokutou Mikiya’s senior during high school, and he was more or less familiar with Shiki. He had handsome features, but did not stand out due to his quiet personality. He was one of the three who made contact{{n1}}.
He quit school for some reason shortly before graduation.
Lio was the first chess piece Souren Araya prepared, and also the one he saved for last. However, the magus was defeated by the Counter Force before Lio could take the stage.
Although Shirazumi Lio lost his commander, he considered it a fortunate turn of events. With the obstructive Araya out of the way, Lio was able to realize his own desire.
He made his face to resemble Shiki, and chose the same clothing as Shiki. Only his hair was left golden, which conjured the image of a lion.
The obsession with the Anima was in his nature. Or, it was a gender identity disorder that he was not aware of. …As far as his attraction to Shiki was concerned, it might be that he was attracted to the male personality rather than the female one.
Lio was something that fell out of *Kara no Kyoukai Shi*, which was the story of Araya. He was supposed to make his exit before the evil mastermind presented himself. However, in order to provide a resolution of the story of Kokutou Mikiya and Ryougi Shiki, the serial killer must stay.
