① The ability to transfer energy to another person. Those who excel at using this ability can even improve the physical prowess and mental fortitude of the recipient.
② While is it possible to transfer energy to a recipient under normal circumstances (without the explicit desire of the recipient, or without doing anything special), there are those with the synchronization ability that require some kind of ceremony to be performed. This acts as a safety lock for the powers of oni-children and individuals with special abilities because of the persecution or abuse they could face (if their powers were to be discovered).
③ The ceremony is a mechanism to allow the synchronizer to remove the subconscious safety lock placed on the ability. Ceremonies differ from family to family.
