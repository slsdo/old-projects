① When the body of a vampire is destroyed, the Curse of Restoration will return it to normal in a short period of time. In order to truly and completely destroy a vampire, an external factor is needed to neutralize the Curse of Restoration faster than the curse can restore the body. Mystic items and such that are capable of doing so are called conceptual weapons.
② A final trump card or secret ability used to dispose of members of the blood-sucking species who were never human at any point in time.
