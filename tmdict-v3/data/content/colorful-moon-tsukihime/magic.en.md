① A mystery distinct from magecraft.
② Magic is that which makes the impossible (something that can’t be achieved regardless of the time and money one has), possible. So, in the present era, in which almost everything is possible, there are only 5 magic. Accordingly, there are only 5 existing magicians.
③ The ultimate goal of most magi is to achieve the power of magic. Roa also falls into this category.{{n1}}
④ At this time only 2 magicians have been revealed. Aozaki Aoko and Zelretch.
⑤ The details of the 5 magic are unknown, however we do know that bringing the dead back to life is a magic, and that Aozaki Aoko’s magic is known as “Magic - Blue.”
⑥ Also note is that magic doesn’t follow the rules of magecraft, a big reason Crimson Moon lost to Zelretch is due to not fully grasping this.
