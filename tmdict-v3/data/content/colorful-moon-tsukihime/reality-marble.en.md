① Intrinsic Bounded Field (Also see the entry for “Marble”)
② The name “marble” comes from glass marbles used in a well-known example of the clustering illusion.
③ A subspecies of marble phantasm. One’s inner world is given shape through world interference that erodes reality.
④ More specifically a reality marble is thought to be realized when a multitude of phenomena are interfered with probability-wise, forcibly invoking the impossible.
⑤ Originally the common knowledge of otherworldly being referred to as “demons.” Though a skill of fairies and demons, after extensive time and practice one can acquire the ability to give shape to images in your mind. A few of the top magi and the Dead Apostle Ancestors are capable of employing a reality marble.
⑥ However, objects created by a reality marble are at best still existences from another world, which means they are not the creation of spirits that are extensions of nature, so they are subject to being corrected or modified by the world.

**Strength**
Unlike marble phantasms, reality marbles can directly affect entities that are independent from nature (such as humans).

**Weakness**
A reality marble is at best a reflection of the creator’s predominant inner world, and cannot be changed freely at will. Thus, a reality marble is far less adaptable than a marble phantasm.
