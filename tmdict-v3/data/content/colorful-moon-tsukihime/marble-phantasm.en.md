① Imagination Materialization. (Also see the entry for “Marble”)
② The name “marble” comes from glass marbles used in a well-known example of the clustering illusion{{n1}}.
③ The user directly connects and imposes their will on the world which creates an interference that transforms the world as they see fit (as they imagine). They make reality an illusion (something impossible in reality).
④ More specifically a marble phantasm is thought to be realized when a multitude of phenomena are interfered with probability-wise, forcibly invoking the impossible{{n2}}.
⑤ What can be materialized is not limited to material objects, anything can be created as long as it’s a possible result of an interference in the probability of (natural) phenomena.
⑥ In the world of *Tsukihime*, a Marble Phantasm is the materialization of a part of an alien world that exists on top of the normal world, the fantasy world born from the imagination of elemental spirits. Therefore, it is possible for regular humans to wander into a Marble Phantasm.{{n3}}

**Strength**
The Marble Phantasm user can transform the world around them at will. It is exceedingly versatile.

**Weakness**
Only nature can be transformed by a Marble Phantasm. A Marble Phantasm is incapable of directly affecting existences independent from nature such as humans. Accordingly, in order to affect an independently existing individual/phenomena, the creator of the Marble Phantasm must first create an object in reality/nature, and then use it to affect the target. The effects of world transformation are not directly applied to the target.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Clustering illusion is when you find “non-random” patterns or groups in actually random sets => Also see the entry for “Marble.”
2. {{note2}} This means that the Marble Phantasm effectively creates a continuous chain of desired coincidences through by manipulating the probability of an event, to realize what is almost a complete overwrite of the world in the Marble Phantasm area. See “Marble.”
3. {{note3}} Spirits are of nature, so the world doesn’t reject a Marble Phantasm, which is a major point of difference from a Reality Marble.
