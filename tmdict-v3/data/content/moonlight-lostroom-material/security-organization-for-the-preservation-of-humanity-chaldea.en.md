Its official name is the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity - Finis Chaldea.
A mageâ€™s workshop built in a place where no country can intervene and Mystery is protected. An organization established to guarantee the future of the civilizations of Earth and mankind. It is not an observatory for watching the stars in the Universe from Earth, but an observatory made for watching the whole Earth from the void.
