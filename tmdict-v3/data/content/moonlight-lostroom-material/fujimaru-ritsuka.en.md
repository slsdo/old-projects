Dream of the living.
A new Master who has just entered Chaldea.
He is an ordinary person no magecraft background who was scouted for having good aptitude for Rayshift.
On the day he came to Chaldea, he collided with Olga Marie, earned a bad reputation from her, and was excluded from the Rayshift experiment. Fortunately, because of this he did not get involved in the “explosion accident in the Command Room,” and survived as the only Master in Chaldea.
The “Master of Chaldea”, who was immature yet overcame the seven Singularities to prevent the Incineration of Human Order.
