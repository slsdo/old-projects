The next generation of HERMES, the Pseudo-Spiritron functional unit at Atlas Institute.
A Spiriton computer completed with technology supplied by Atlas Institute, a division of the Mage Association. TRISMEGISTUS makes it possible to prove that the Master “‘exists’ Spiritron-wise” regardless of the time period, and as a result interfere with the past.
Thanks to the fact that it is the latest model, it’s possible to transfer and recalculate the soul to the real world, which exists outside of the cyber world.
Despite the term Spiritron being in its name, it can be thought of as a quantum computer made using magecraft concepts.
