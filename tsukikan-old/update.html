			<h1>Site Update</h1>

			<h3>2012-02-11</h3>

			<p>More content! Aside from the <a href="misc/kanwatsukihime/afterword.html">Afterword section</a> that was added to <a href="misc/kanwatsukihime/index.html">Kanwa Tsukihime</a>, we present you <a href="misc/staff-roundtable-the-first-night.html">Staff Roundtable - The First Night</a> and <a href="misc/staff-roundtable-the-second-night.html">Staff Roundtable - The Second Night</a>! They are both quite old, but contain some juicy info on our favorite <em>Tsukihime</em> heroines. Also added is <a href="misc/arcueid-model.html">a small page</a> on the model Arcueid is based on.</p>

			<p>Last but not least, we have a real special treat for you all. After Lair-soft released <em>Kusarihime</em> (a classic by all means) in 2002, the game's scenario writer, Hoshizora Meteo, brought Nasu Kinoko, Tanaka Romeo, and Urobuchi Gen together to talk about the game. From that talk came a fanbook titled <em>Kusarihime Dokuhon</em>. The three went their separate ways after the meeting. Later, Tanaka Romeo created <em>CROSSâ€ CHANNEL</em>, Urobuchi Gen made <em>Saya no Uta</em>, and Nasu came up with Heaven's Feel route for <em>Fate/stay night</em>. Many attributed this dialog between the "Big 4" as the birthplace of those classics. Without further ado, we present you this famed dialog: "<a href="misc/star-scenario-writer-interview.html">Star Scenario Writer Interview</a>"!</p>

			<p>Again, we're also looking for volunteer writers and translators who are interested in helping out with the site. If you are interested, <a href="another/contact">contact us</a>!</p>

			<h3>2012-02-08</h3>

			<p>Happy new year! To start the year off, a special <a href="misc/kanwatsukihime/afterword.html">Afterword section</a> has been added to <a href="misc/kanwatsukihime/index.html">Kanwa Tsukihime</a>. Keep an eye out for more stuff coming very soon!</p>

			<h3>2011-12-09</h3>

			<p>We've got an early present for you! Things finished ahead of schedule, so without further ado, we present... <a href="misc/kanwatsukihime/index.html">TYPE-MOON Long Interview - Kanwa Tsukihime</a>!</p>

			<p><a href="misc/kanwatsukihime/index.html">Kanwa Tsukihime</a> (Tsukihime Idle Talk) is a long interview conducted by Mandarake with TYPE-MOON in 2001, after the release of <em>Tsukihime</em>. The original interview was posted on Mandarake's website (it is no longer available on Mandarake). A revised version of the interview appeared in <em>Tsukihime Dokuhon Plus Period</em> in 2004. The republished version is more concise, easier to read, with less extraneous words, with unncessary bits left out, and left out an extra section. This is a translation of the original web version of the interview, with several parts revised using contents from the republished version.</p>

			<p>We hope you enjoy reading the interview, there are quite a bit of interesting stories and tidbits from TYPE-MOON's early days.</p>

			<h3>2011-12-06</h3>

			<p>Long time no see! This time we come with  several editorial articles, some of them from older sites/projects, while others brand new. Editorials are more opinion-based, and have timestamps, since some may be more relevant when read under the context of certain time period.</p>

			<p>We also made small improvements here and there, and have been expanding the <a href="another/index">Another database</a>.</p>

			<p>This is not all, however, we have a big feature coming up at the end of the year, please look forward to it!</p>

			<h3>2011-07-13</h3>

			<p>It's been a while! In the past few months, work on Another has been progressing slowly but surely. The <a href="another/bbs">BBS</a> as been improved quite a bit, so feel free to join in on the discussions!</p>

			<p>We've got <a href="misc/talk-nasu-kinoko-x-urobuchi-gen.html">a new interview</a> for you all, this one is a blast from the past, from back when TYPE-MOON was still a doujin company.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Added "Talk: Nasu Kinoko X Urobuchi Gen."</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2011-04-17</h3>

			<p>Nothing much happened since last month, been busy updating and refining entries in <a href="another/">Another</a>, so go take a look when you have time ^^</p>

			<p>Other than that, the biggest change would be the Links section, with tons of new links added. Entries for each serie in the Works section has also been updated somewhat, now with a bit more information than before. The Fandom page has been removed since it sort of got merged into the Links section. Finally, little bits of editing and refinement here and there.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Updated Links section with new links and a new layout.</li>
				<li>Updated all entries in Works section.</li>
				<li>Fixed some typo in Timeline.</li>
				<li>Removed Fandom section.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2011-03-26</h3>

			<p>We have some HUGE updates! First of all, another new <em>Mahoyo</em> interview in the form of <a href="misc/rebirth-of-the-origin.html">Rebirth of the Origin</a>, from <em>TYPE-MOON Ace 5</em>! Also, we decided from now on to use [Last First] for all Japanese names for consistency purposes.</p>
			
			<p>With that out of way, time for the real news. As you may have noticed, the site looks different in many places. We did a complete overhaul of the site organization-wise. First and foremost, we'd like to reveal our newest experiment, <a href="another/">Another</a>. What it is you ask? We hope to eventually grow it into a TYPE-MOON product database, in the sense that all TM products, be it games, books, or collectibles, will eventually get their own entry in the database.</p>

			<p>We have already moved all the products from Tsuki-kan's Works section over to <a href="another/">Another</a>, which helped make the main site more clean and smaller. Also, the plan is to eventually have users (Anonymous or not) freely contribute to the database (we've all heard that one before).</p>

			<p>Also launching with Another is <a href="another/bbs">a new discussion board</a> (it lives!). Feel free to discuss anything you want, or (and here's the important part) give us some feedback!</p>

			<p>Another is powered by Drupal 7, which came out not long ago. This will also serve as a experiement to test out the new Drupal. Many birds with one stone! Anyways, see below for a full list of changes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Added Another and Forum</li>
				<li>Added "Rebirth of the Origin."</li>
				<li>Added new headers for the Works pages.</li>
				<li>Added some new images in the Works section.</li>
				<li>Updated navigation and menu to reflect new site structure.</li>
				<li>Updated Japanese names to [Last First] format.</li>
				<li>Fixed many sections throughout the site to reflect the new site changes.</li>
				<li>Removed Others from Works section since everything has been moved to Another.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2011-01-17</h3>

			<p>First update of 2011! First of all, we have <a href="misc/type-moon-ace-4-nasu-kinoko-interview.html">yet another interview</a> for you all! This one was released a while ago, but should still be somewhat interesting to read. Also, quite a few different sections were updated, including the Timeline!</p>
			
			<p>As the site become bigger and bigger, things are getting harder to organize and update... maybe we'll add a feedback section soon (not that we didn't have one before, it got nuked, lol). Also, the Works section needs to be organized more, need to come up with a better way to organize the works as more and more spin-off/adapation/etc. are released. Look for a new Anime/Manga section soon.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Added "TYPE-MOON Ace 4 Nasu Kinoko Interview."</li>
				<li>Updated Timeline with 2010 info.</li>
				<li>Updated Fate section.</li>
				<li>Updated Mahoyo section.</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>2010-12-29</h3>

			<p>Been a while since the last update, quite a few things happened during the past four months, but first things first, <a href="misc/the-next-world-of-type-moon.html">a new interview</a> (note that the translation may be a bit sloppy in certain places... this has been in the works for like, what, six months? The last couple weeks has basically been along the lines of "let's just get this out the door before the new year, and before it decomposes!") Expect more updates in the near future!</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Added "The next world of TYPE-MOON."</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2010-09-09</h3>

			<p>From now on the frontpage will be a place for information on the latest site updates, as well as random ramblings. The introductory stuff has been merged into the History section.</p>

			<p>Originally there were some big updates planned for the <em>Mahoyo</em> section of the site, but seeing as how the game has been delayed from 9/30 to winter, the updates will probably come at a slower pace.</p>

			<p>Finally, in case you missed it, check out two new <em>Mahoyo</em>-related interviews that were posted a few weeks ago: "<a href="misc/tech-gian-mahou-tsukai-no-yoru-questions-and-answers.html">Tech Gian Mahou Tsukai no Yoru Questions and Answers</a>" + "<a href="misc/the-secret-of-mahou-tsukai-no-yorus-birth.html">The Secret of Mahou Tsukai no Yoru's Birth</a>"</p>
