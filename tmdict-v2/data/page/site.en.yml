    <h3 id="site-version">Version</h3>

    <p>The glossary uses a vX.Y.Z (for example v3.1.4) versioning system to keep track of changes. Z changes when modifications, such as correcting errors or adding missing texts, happen to existing contents. Y changes whenever glossary from a new source or a new language is added. X changes only when significant modification of the glossary takes place, such as entire new sections being added or a change in data format.</p>

    <p><strong>v1.1.2 <span class="highlight">[2016-05-01]</span></strong></p>

    <p>Long time no see! The past few months we’ve been busy upgrading the site’s backend and porting contents to a better database, the codebase is now a lot cleaner and the dictionary database much more scalable and easier to update. This upgrade will also make porting TMdict to mobile apps in the future a reality.</p>

    <p>For those who like to see everything on one page, we’ve also added a “Books” section, where you can browse the contents by glossary. The diff feature has been taken down, as everything (including the database) is now available on GitHub and version controlled. Finally, minor edits have been made to several categories and entry translations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Major overhaul of site backend</li>
      <li>Moved glossary database to SQLite</li>
      <li>Added books/glossary section</li>
      <li>Removed glossary diff feature</li>
      <li>Edited several incorrectly translated/assigned categories</li>
      <li>Edited Chinese translation errors in <em>Tsukihime</em> glossary</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>v1.1.1 <span class="highlight">[2015-08-16]</span></strong></p>

    <p>A glossary diff feature has been implemented in order to keep track of changes to site content. Missing entries in the Chinese version of Tsukihime Dictionary Revised (<em>Plus Period</em>) have also been added.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Added glossary diff feature to keep track of change</li>
      <li>Added missing Chinese entries from Tsukihime Dictionary Revised (<em>Dokuhon</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>v1.1.0 <span class="highlight">[2015-07-29]</span></strong></p>

    <p>Some big backend changes, the site now supports 3 kinds of entries: 1) entry with a common category, a normal glossary entry with one or more sortable category/tag 2) entry with unique category, an entry with a one-of-a-kind category, non-filterable (since by definition there’s already only one of it), this is to account for a select few glossary formats, and 3) entries with no category, this opens up the possibility to add “non-glossary” entries such as those from <em>Fate/Complete Material 3</em>, think of it more as a future-proof change. Categories are now also clickable and will lead you to a filtered list when clicked. Most of the changes are under-the-hood. In terms of content, entries from Nasu’s <em>Notes.</em> have been added, bumping out version number to 1.1.0.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Changed site categorization scheme for future expansion</li>
      <li>Added Notes. glossary (<em>Dokuhon</em>) Japanese/English/Chinese content</li>

      <li>Added Tsukihime Dictionary Revised (<em>Dokuhon</em>) Japanese content</li>
